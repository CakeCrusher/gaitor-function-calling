After reviewing feedback from customers and our community, we are extending support for those models until at least June 13, 2024.\\nWhen we release new model versions, our top priority is to make newer models smarter across the board. We are targeting improvements on a large number of axes, such as instruction following, factual accuracy, and refusal behavior. For instance, the\\ngpt-4-0613\\nmodel introduced last month resulted in significant improvement on calling functions.\\u00a0\\nWe look at a large number of evaluation metrics to determine if a new model should be released. While the majority of metrics have improved, there may be some tasks where the performance gets worse. This is why we allow API users to pin the model version. For example, you can use\\ninstead of the generic\\ngpt-4\\n, which points to the latest model version. Each individually pinned model is stable, meaning that we won\\u2019t make changes that impact the outputs.\\u00a0\\nWe are working hard to ensure that new versions result in improvements across a comprehensive range of tasks. That said, our evaluation methodology isn\\u2019t perfect, and we\\u2019re constantly improving it. One way to help us ensure new models get better at domains you care about, is to contribute to\\nthe OpenAI Evals library\\nto report shortcomings in our models.\\nWe understand that model upgrades and behavior changes can be disruptive to your applications. We are working on ways to give developers more stability and visibility into how we release and deprecate models.\\nWe released\\ngpt-3.5-turbo\\nearlier this year, and in only a short few months, have seen\\nincredible applications\\nbuilt by developers on top of these models.\\nToday, we\\u2019re following up with some exciting updates:\\nnew function calling capability in the Chat Completions API\\nupdated and more steerable versions of\\nnew 16k context version of\\n(vs the standard 4k version)\\n75% cost reduction on our state-of-the-art embeddings model\\n25% cost reduction on input tokens for\\nannouncing the deprecation timeline for the\\nmodels\\nAll of these models come with the same data privacy and security guarantees we introduced on March 1 \\u2014 customers own all outputs generated from their requests and their API data will not be used for training.\\nFunction calling\\nDevelopers can now describe functions to\\ngpt-3.5-turbo-0613\\n, and have the model intelligently choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call those functions. This is a new way to more reliably connect GPT's capabilities with external tools and APIs.\\nThese models have been fine-tuned to both detect when a function needs to be called (depending on the user\\u2019s input) and to respond with JSON that adheres to the function signature. Function calling allows developers to more reliably get structured data back from the model. For example, developers can:\\nCreate chatbots that answer questions by calling external tools (e.g., like ChatGPT Plugins)\\nConvert queries such as \\u201cEmail Anya to see if she wants to get coffee next Friday\\u201d to a function call like\\nsend_email(to: string, body: string)\\n, or \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the weather like in Boston?\\u201d to\\nget_current_weather(location: string, unit: 'celsius' | 'fahrenheit')\\n.\\nConvert natural language into API calls or database queries\\nConvert \\u201cWho are my top ten customers this month?\\u201d to an internal API call such as\\nget_customers_by_revenue(start_date: string, end_date: string, limit: int)\\n, or \\u201cHow many orders did Acme, Inc. place last month?\\u201d to a SQL query using\\nsql_query(query: string)\\nExtract structured data from text\\nDefine a function called\\nextract_people_data(people: [{name: string, birthday: string, location: string}])\\n, to extract all people mentioned in a Wikipedia article.\\nThese use cases are enabled by new API parameters in our\\n/v1/chat/completions\\nendpoint,\\nfunctions\\nfunction_call\\n, that allow developers to describe functions to the model via JSON Schema, and optionally ask it to call a specific function.

If you already have an account, sign in.\n\n2. **Create a Repl**: Once you're signed in, find the \"Create a Repl\" button and configure a Python Repl. Give it a suitable name for your AI extension.\n\n   ![Create Repl Image](https://tinyurl.com/mrysxzwd)\n\n3. **Create a 'main.py' file**: Look at the left panel of your Repl and create a new file named 'main.py'. This is where you'll write the code for your AI extension.\n\n   ![Repl First Look Image](https://tinyurl.com/5x5vt43h)\n\n4. **Add Secrets**: If your AI extension requires any sensitive information like an API key, you can navigate to the \"Secrets\" button on the bottom left panel. Add the API key as a secret to keep it hidden.\n\n   ![Repl Add Secrets Image](https://tinyurl.com/5355xa9u)\n\n5. **Install dependencies**: In the Repl's shell, install any dependencies or packages that your 'main.py' file requires using the 'pip install [Package Name Here]' command. You can also see an example of how to retrieve and use a secret API key in the image below.\n\n   ![Repl Install Dependencies Image](https://tinyurl.com/3redecxu)\n\n   **Bonus Tip**: You can connect your 'main.py' file with a database like Firebase to keep track of how many requests your AI extension has handled and what it has produced.\n\n   ![Database Advice](https://tinyurl.com/49be46b3)\n\nThese steps will help you set up your AI extension on repl.it. Remember to write the necessary code in 'main.py' to implement the functionality of your AI extension."

However, I can help you understand how to create a pie graph representing the world's population per continent using data and graphing tools.\n\nTo create a pie graph representing the world's population per continent, you would need data on the population of each continent. Once you have the data, you can use various graphing tools or software to create the pie graph. Here are the general steps:\n\n1. Gather data: Collect data on the population of each continent. You can find this information from reliable sources such as the United Nations or World Bank.\n\n2. Calculate percentages: Calculate the percentage of the world's population that each continent represents. Divide the population of each continent by the total world population and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\n3. Choose a graphing tool: Select a graphing tool or software that allows you to create pie graphs. Some popular options include Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or specialized data visualization tools like Tableau or Plotly.\n\n4. Enter data and create the graph: Enter the continent names and their corresponding population percentages into the graphing tool. Use the tool's features to create a pie graph based on the data you entered.\n\n5. Customize the graph: Customize the pie graph by adding labels, colors, and other visual elements to make it clear and visually appealing.\n\n6. Save or export the graph: Once you are satisfied with the pie graph, save or export it in a suitable format (e.g., PNG, JPEG, or PDF) for sharing or further use.\n\nRemember to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data you use for creating the pie graph."

accident a couple of years ago one of our (00:20) speakers had to cancel at the last minute so we just threw together this (00:24) idea let's bring up some startups this is NYC we've never done it on stage (00:29) before but the idea was you know a lot of people they've gone through YC (00:34) it's coming up to demo day and actually they've never had a real experience like (00:39) pitching an investor just like cold someone who doesn't know anything about (00:43) them um so we got this idea hey let's just (00:46) try it out uh you know have a Founder come up give their pitch (00:51) and just to warn you they're usually like pretty rough that's kind of the (00:55) point of it and then we have a partner in this case it'll be Sam come repitch (01:00) the business and hopefully he does a smoother job (01:05) we'll see um (01:07) a few things to keep in mind this will be a little bit like the office hours (01:10) except not at all helpful and um probably uh maybe a little bit more uh (01:19) brutal so just to kind of give you some context like as a seed investor (01:25) um something you have to keep in mind is that the median startup is ultimately (01:29) worth about zero dollars um and probably 95 percent of startups (01:35) are a bad investment so you kind of get in a mode where (01:39) you're just a default no right and it's a very it's a little bit cold because (01:44) you know people are pouring off their hearts and they're preparing all their (01:47) dreams into it but uh you know nine times out of (01:54) uh out of a thousand probably um no the other way around anyway it's always if (01:59) you have to say no a lot um and so when you when you when you see a business (02:04) um what you're looking for is like why are you the exception right so it's not (02:07) good enough just to be like oh that sounds like a nice business I have to (02:11) think like wow this is that one business that one that I've been saying no for (02:15) months but today I'm going to say yes so just to just to kind of frame it for you (02:19) all right uh first up let's give a round of applause (02:31) let's see also just for context I don't know (02:38) anything so uh I'm not actually pretending that I didn't bother to learn (02:43) anything so this is I'm hearing about the business for the first time so okay (02:49) yeah launch in okay introduce yourself so (02:54) uh agricultural energy and mining companies uh higher ships and just to be (03:01) clear I'm not talking about containers I'm talking about full ships (03:07) Okay so you do something with ships I got that (03:11) part um (03:13) so this is like if I need to go rent is this like a rental like I need to go (03:17) rent so you are a commodity Trader you need to shift 50 000 tons of coal from (03:24) South Africa to Rotterdam and you come to us to find that ship I see so I took (03:29) a position on coal in South Africa and then (03:33) get it someplace else and what would I do today well I don't know anything (03:38) about this business so today you would pick up your phone and your email and (03:43) you would call five to ten Brokers and say hey I need to move this stuff (03:48) I see so this is like a marketplace where right now these Brokers and they (03:52) what do they take a big cut and then you're gonna like what's the value (03:55) proposition for me as as a Trader so think (04:00) I think you're speaking to all these different Brokers and it can take you (04:04) three to 24 hours to get some indications back it can take you (04:07) um up to two weeks and to actually book that ship uh with shipper Max we use (04:12) satellite technology and navigation and to cover every ship on Earth and we can (04:18) tell you which ship can make it in time and fit the specifications and is open (04:22) in seconds okay so is the idea that it's just (04:26) easier for me or do I get a better price like what's what closes the deal so this (04:32) there's two things when you think about trading one it's like a a very binary (04:36) thing as a commodity Trader and you need to know what your delivered price is and (04:42) to the customer otherwise someone else can come come and get that deal instead (04:46) of you and both myself and my co-founder have lost multi-million pound deals for (04:51) not getting Freight fast enough and and the second proposition is really (04:56) um service would you rather uh speak to five Brokers and receive thousands of (05:01) emails for a per deal or would you rather say this is my let's go (05:07) uh the letter sounds better I'm not in that position so so do you have a lot of (05:13) traction I mean are you what's your growth rate so we launched um about uh (05:17) our beta about seven weeks ago and since then what we were trying to do is talk (05:22) to these charterers these Traders and to see if they would talk to us and give us (05:26) requests and to date we've had about 4.5 million worth of gross and (05:32) um last week was um a great win for us because we signed one of the uh largest (05:38) energy trading companies in the world they shift 150 million and tons of (05:43) products annually and what does that deal represent for (05:46) you how much revenue are you going to make off of that so it's we're still (05:50) competing with other Brokers right now the revenue potential was 15 million (05:54) annually so we're now receiving those requests to compete on a deal by deal (05:58) basis to be faster and better so from their perspective you're just another (06:02) broker is that right yeah right they don't even know that you're like a tech (06:05) company they're just like oh new broker yeah is that good or bad for you (06:10) um so we're kind of edging are we in the way I've started this conversation (06:14) is saying like hey um our goal is to make this much much (06:19) faster like help us get there and so they're giving us a go they want smarter (06:24) intelligence and the smaller companies want better access to the market (06:29) um so today we're just saying yeah it's not all perfect out of the box right now (06:34) but um give us a go we're not worse than the (06:37) other Brokers have they used you yet or do they just say well think about you no (06:41) yeah they they they're giving us requests too so how many ships have you (06:45) shipped we haven't shipped in right now we've basically been getting those (06:49) requests which was our first test to see will they give them to us because that's (06:53) actually quite a big deal because they're telling you Market information (06:57) and does that mean that they're sending you the request but then they're going (07:00) with a different broker um right now basically what our problem (07:05) has been is that we (07:08) um need a bit more funding to get uh more men on the ground to help fulfill (07:13) these requests and because right now some of the larger brokers (07:18) have better intelligence and so we're starting kind of from zero and each time (07:25) um we're kind of getting closer and closer to actually booking that deal and (07:28) beating the brokers so you haven't actually won any deals yet no yeah how (07:33) soon will you win a deal I think next week all right well (07:36) talk next week so how much will that deal be worth then (07:42) assuming you do get this deal next week and that should be worth ten thousand (07:46) dollars and and what will be your costs behind (07:49) is that like pure profit for you uh that's like pure profit so it's our cost (07:54) is just like the men the people now why is this (07:59) why is this going to be like 100 billion dollar company (08:03) um so it's a huge market and so today (08:08) like the the amount that these Traders spend on brokerage fees today is about (08:14) three billion and dollars at least at current market low rates (08:20) and the largest company today is a company called Clarkson's who (08:26) um make 240 million GBP and per annum and I mean (08:32) to me that also means like you have some really formidable competitors like are (08:36) they really just gonna roll over and let you take their business (08:39) uh well no I don't think they're gonna roll over but um (08:42) so I think what's kind of what's interesting that's happening is that (08:47) the problem with these big guys like they are superior to the small Brokers (08:51) right they have more intelligence and they can serve bigger clients better (08:55) but who they can't serve is the little guys (08:59) um and they can't serve them because it's so manual with all their processes (09:04) so so basically you're thinking you're gonna come in at the bottom of the (09:08) market where they're just totally neglected yeah is that who you're going (09:11) after right now is that who this first customer is is that at the bottom of the (09:14) market um no we we 've been starting at the (09:17) bottom Market but actually a lot of the big just want to talk to us too because (09:21) of the superior intelligence that we can actually leverage free data but but I (09:26) mean if if there is this bottom of the market that's totally neglected why not (09:29) because you haven't done any ships yet right like why not just go find some of (09:33) these guys who are super neglected no we we're all working with those as well (09:39) so is this it seems like I see a lot of startups (09:43) where they're basically the high level pitch is there's these Brokers that make (09:47) a lot of money and we're going to cut them out with technology and take all (09:51) the money um but I mean just as a general form (09:54) like the most uh yeah obvious for me and familiar to most (09:58) of us is like the real estate market right like Redfin or someone was going (10:01) to come in and just blow away the Brokers but so far it seems like I don't (10:05) know if I've seen any of that those markets it seems like the Brokers are (10:08) very good at holding on to their position so the key key thing in this (10:13) market I mean I mean there's one thing to say that we still have Brokers and so (10:17) we're not a pure technology play We're enabling our Brokers to be much smarter (10:21) than anyone else and the cool thing about this Market is that (10:25) um intelligence is the main driver uh Traders reward their Brokers with deals (10:31) based on intelligence because you need that intelligence to keep getting good (10:35) rates so if\"}",

accident a couple of years ago one of our (00:20) speakers had to cancel at the last minute so we just threw together this (00:24) idea let's bring up some startups this is NYC we've never done it on stage (00:29) before but the idea was you know a lot of people they've gone through YC (00:34) it's coming up to demo day and actually they've never had a real experience like (00:39) pitching an investor just like cold someone who doesn't know anything about (00:43) them um so we got this idea hey let's just (00:46) try it out uh you know have a Founder come up give their pitch (00:51) and just to warn you they're usually like pretty rough that's kind of the (00:55) point of it and then we have a partner in this case it'll be Sam come repitch (01:00) the business and hopefully he does a smoother job (01:05) we'll see um (01:07) a few things to keep in mind this will be a little bit like the office hours (01:10) except not at all helpful and um probably uh maybe a little bit more uh (01:19) brutal so just to kind of give you some context like as a seed investor (01:25) um something you have to keep in mind is that the median startup is ultimately (01:29) worth about zero dollars um and probably 95 percent of startups (01:35) are a bad investment so you kind of get in a mode where (01:39) you're just a default no right and it's a very it's a little bit cold because (01:44) you know people are pouring off their hearts and they're preparing all their (01:47) dreams into it but uh you know nine times out of (01:54) uh out of a thousand probably um no the other way around anyway it's always if (01:59) you have to say no a lot um and so when you when you when you see a business (02:04) um what you're looking for is like why are you the exception right so it's not (02:07) good enough just to be like oh that sounds like a nice business I have to (02:11) think like wow this is that one business that one that I've been saying no for (02:15) months but today I'm going to say yes so just to just to kind of frame it for you (02:19) all right uh first up let's give a round of applause (02:31) let's see also just for context I don't know (02:38) anything so uh I'm not actually pretending that I didn't bother to learn (02:43) anything so this is I'm hearing about the business for the first time so okay (02:49) yeah launch in okay introduce yourself so (02:54) uh agricultural energy and mining companies uh higher ships and just to be (03:01) clear I'm not talking about containers I'm talking about full ships (03:07) Okay so you do something with ships I got that (03:11) part um (03:13) so this is like if I need to go rent is this like a rental like I need to go (03:17) rent so you are a commodity Trader you need to shift 50 000 tons of coal from (03:24) South Africa to Rotterdam and you come to us to find that ship I see so I took (03:29) a position on coal in South Africa and then (03:33) get it someplace else and what would I do today well I don't know anything (03:38) about this business so today you would pick up your phone and your email and (03:43) you would call five to ten Brokers and say hey I need to move this stuff (03:48) I see so this is like a marketplace where right now these Brokers and they (03:52) what do they take a big cut and then you're gonna like what's the value (03:55) proposition for me as as a Trader so think (04:00) I think you're speaking to all these different Brokers and it can take you (04:04) three to 24 hours to get some indications back it can take you (04:07) um up to two weeks and to actually book that ship uh with shipper Max we use (04:12) satellite technology and navigation and to cover every ship on Earth and we can (04:18) tell you which ship can make it in time and fit the specifications and is open (04:22) in seconds okay so is the idea that it's just (04:26) easier for me or do I get a better price like what's what closes the deal so this (04:32) there's two things when you think about trading one it's like a a very binary (04:36) thing as a commodity Trader and you need to know what your delivered price is and (04:42) to the customer otherwise someone else can come come and get that deal instead (04:46) of you and both myself and my co-founder have lost multi-million pound deals for (04:51) not getting Freight fast enough and and the second proposition is really (04:56) um service would you rather uh speak to five Brokers and receive thousands of (05:01) emails for a per deal or would you rather say this is my let's go (05:07) uh the letter sounds better I'm not in that position so so do you have a lot of (05:13) traction I mean are you what's your growth rate so we launched um about uh (05:17) our beta about seven weeks ago and since then what we were trying to do is talk (05:22) to these charterers these Traders and to see if they would talk to us and give us (05:26) requests and to date we've had about 4.5 million worth of gross and (05:32) um last week was um a great win for us because we signed one of the uh largest (05:38) energy trading companies in the world they shift 150 million and tons of (05:43) products annually and what does that deal represent for (05:46) you how much revenue are you going to make off of that so it's we're still (05:50) competing with other Brokers right now the revenue potential was 15 million (05:54) annually so we're now receiving those requests to compete on a deal by deal (05:58) basis to be faster and better so from their perspective you're just another (06:02) broker is that right yeah right they don't even know that you're like a tech (06:05) company they're just like oh new broker yeah is that good or bad for you (06:10) um so we're kind of edging are we in the way I've started this conversation (06:14) is saying like hey um our goal is to make this much much (06:19) faster like help us get there and so they're giving us a go they want smarter (06:24) intelligence and the smaller companies want better access to the market (06:29) um so today we're just saying yeah it's not all perfect out of the box right now (06:34) but um give us a go we're not worse than the (06:37) other Brokers have they used you yet or do they just say well think about you no (06:41) yeah they they they're giving us requests too so how many ships have you (06:45) shipped we haven't shipped in right now we've basically been getting those (06:49) requests which was our first test to see will they give them to us because that's (06:53) actually quite a big deal because they're telling you Market information (06:57) and does that mean that they're sending you the request but then they're going (07:00) with a different broker um right now basically what our problem (07:05) has been is that we (07:08) um need a bit more funding to get uh more men on the ground to help fulfill (07:13) these requests and because right now some of the larger brokers (07:18) have better intelligence and so we're starting kind of from zero and each time (07:25) um we're kind of getting closer and closer to actually booking that deal and (07:28) beating the brokers so you haven't actually won any deals yet no yeah how (07:33) soon will you win a deal I think next week all right well (07:36) talk next week so how much will that deal be worth then (07:42) assuming you do get this deal next week and that should be worth ten thousand (07:46) dollars and and what will be your costs behind (07:49) is that like pure profit for you uh that's like pure profit so it's our cost (07:54) is just like the men the people now why is this (07:59) why is this going to be like 100 billion dollar company (08:03) um so it's a huge market and so today (08:08) like the the amount that these Traders spend on brokerage fees today is about (08:14) three billion and dollars at least at current market low rates (08:20) and the largest company today is a company called Clarkson's who (08:26) um make 240 million GBP and per annum and I mean (08:32) to me that also means like you have some really formidable competitors like are (08:36) they really just gonna roll over and let you take their business (08:39) uh well no I don't think they're gonna roll over but um (08:42) so I think what's kind of what's interesting that's happening is that (08:47) the problem with these big guys like they are superior to the small Brokers (08:51) right they have more intelligence and they can serve bigger clients better (08:55) but who they can't serve is the little guys (08:59) um and they can't serve them because it's so manual with all their processes (09:04) so so basically you're thinking you're gonna come in at the bottom of the (09:08) market where they're just totally neglected yeah is that who you're going (09:11) after right now is that who this first customer is is that at the bottom of the (09:14) market um no we we 've been starting at the (09:17) bottom Market but actually a lot of the big just want to talk to us too because (09:21) of the superior intelligence that we can actually leverage free data but but I (09:26) mean if if there is this bottom of the market that's totally neglected why not (09:29) because you haven't done any ships yet right like why not just go find some of (09:33) these guys who are super neglected no we we're all working with those as well (09:39) so is this it seems like I see a lot of startups (09:43) where they're basically the high level pitch is there's these Brokers that make (09:47) a lot of money and we're going to cut them out with technology and take all (09:51) the money um but I mean just as a general form (09:54) like the most uh yeah obvious for me and familiar to most (09:58) of us is like the real estate market right like Redfin or someone was going (10:01) to come in and just blow away the Brokers but so far it seems like I don't (10:05) know if I've seen any of that those markets it seems like the Brokers are (10:08) very good at holding on to their position so the key key thing in this (10:13) market I mean I mean there's one thing to say that we still have Brokers and so (10:17) we're not a pure technology play We're enabling our Brokers to be much smarter (10:21) than anyone else and the cool thing about this Market is that (10:25) um intelligence is the main driver uh Traders reward their Brokers with deals (10:31) based on intelligence because you need that intelligence to keep getting good (10:35) rates so if\"}",

accident a couple of years ago one of our (00:20) speakers had to cancel at the last minute so we just threw together this (00:24) idea let's bring up some startups this is NYC we've never done it on stage (00:29) before but the idea was you know a lot of people they've gone through YC (00:34) it's coming up to demo day and actually they've never had a real experience like (00:39) pitching an investor just like cold someone who doesn't know anything about (00:43) them um so we got this idea hey let's just (00:46) try it out uh you know have a Founder come up give their pitch (00:51) and just to warn you they're usually like pretty rough that's kind of the (00:55) point of it and then we have a partner in this case it'll be Sam come repitch (01:00) the business and hopefully he does a smoother job (01:05) we'll see um (01:07) a few things to keep in mind this will be a little bit like the office hours (01:10) except not at all helpful and um probably uh maybe a little bit more uh (01:19) brutal so just to kind of give you some context like as a seed investor (01:25) um something you have to keep in mind is that the median startup is ultimately (01:29) worth about zero dollars um and probably 95 percent of startups (01:35) are a bad investment so you kind of get in a mode where (01:39) you're just a default no right and it's a very it's a little bit cold because (01:44) you know people are pouring off their hearts and they're preparing all their (01:47) dreams into it but uh you know nine times out of (01:54) uh out of a thousand probably um no the other way around anyway it's always if (01:59) you have to say no a lot um and so when you when you when you see a business (02:04) um what you're looking for is like why are you the exception right so it's not (02:07) good enough just to be like oh that sounds like a nice business I have to (02:11) think like wow this is that one business that one that I've been saying no for (02:15) months but today I'm going to say yes so just to just to kind of frame it for you (02:19) all right uh first up let's give a round of applause (02:31) let's see also just for context I don't know (02:38) anything so uh I'm not actually pretending that I didn't bother to learn (02:43) anything so this is I'm hearing about the business for the first time so okay (02:49) yeah launch in okay introduce yourself so (02:54) uh agricultural energy and mining companies uh higher ships and just to be (03:01) clear I'm not talking about containers I'm talking about full ships (03:07) Okay so you do something with ships I got that (03:11) part um (03:13) so this is like if I need to go rent is this like a rental like I need to go (03:17) rent so you are a commodity Trader you need to shift 50 000 tons of coal from (03:24) South Africa to Rotterdam and you come to us to find that ship I see so I took (03:29) a position on coal in South Africa and then (03:33) get it someplace else and what would I do today well I don't know anything (03:38) about this business so today you would pick up your phone and your email and (03:43) you would call five to ten Brokers and say hey I need to move this stuff (03:48) I see so this is like a marketplace where right now these Brokers and they (03:52) what do they take a big cut and then you're gonna like what's the value (03:55) proposition for me as as a Trader so think (04:00) I think you're speaking to all these different Brokers and it can take you (04:04) three to 24 hours to get some indications back it can take you (04:07) um up to two weeks and to actually book that ship uh with shipper Max we use (04:12) satellite technology and navigation and to cover every ship on Earth and we can (04:18) tell you which ship can make it in time and fit the specifications and is open (04:22) in seconds okay so is the idea that it's just (04:26) easier for me or do I get a better price like what's what closes the deal so this (04:32) there's two things when you think about trading one it's like a a very binary (04:36) thing as a commodity Trader and you need to know what your delivered price is and (04:42) to the customer otherwise someone else can come come and get that deal instead (04:46) of you and both myself and my co-founder have lost multi-million pound deals for (04:51) not getting Freight fast enough and and the second proposition is really (04:56) um service would you rather uh speak to five Brokers and receive thousands of (05:01) emails for a per deal or would you rather say this is my let's go (05:07) uh the letter sounds better I'm not in that position so so do you have a lot of (05:13) traction I mean are you what's your growth rate so we launched um about uh (05:17) our beta about seven weeks ago and since then what we were trying to do is talk (05:22) to these charterers these Traders and to see if they would talk to us and give us (05:26) requests and to date we've had about 4.5 million worth of gross and (05:32) um last week was um a great win for us because we signed one of the uh largest (05:38) energy trading companies in the world they shift 150 million and tons of (05:43) products annually and what does that deal represent for (05:46) you how much revenue are you going to make off of that so it's we're still (05:50) competing with other Brokers right now the revenue potential was 15 million (05:54) annually so we're now receiving those requests to compete on a deal by deal (05:58) basis to be faster and better so from their perspective you're just another (06:02) broker is that right yeah right they don't even know that you're like a tech (06:05) company they're just like oh new broker yeah is that good or bad for you (06:10) um so we're kind of edging are we in the way I've started this conversation (06:14) is saying like hey um our goal is to make this much much (06:19) faster like help us get there and so they're giving us a go they want smarter (06:24) intelligence and the smaller companies want better access to the market (06:29) um so today we're just saying yeah it's not all perfect out of the box right now (06:34) but um give us a go we're not worse than the (06:37) other Brokers have they used you yet or do they just say well think about you no (06:41) yeah they they they're giving us requests too so how many ships have you (06:45) shipped we haven't shipped in right now we've basically been getting those (06:49) requests which was our first test to see will they give them to us because that's (06:53) actually quite a big deal because they're telling you Market information (06:57) and does that mean that they're sending you the request but then they're going (07:00) with a different broker um right now basically what our problem (07:05) has been is that we (07:08) um need a bit more funding to get uh more men on the ground to help fulfill (07:13) these requests and because right now some of the larger brokers (07:18) have better intelligence and so we're starting kind of from zero and each time (07:25) um we're kind of getting closer and closer to actually booking that deal and (07:28) beating the brokers so you haven't actually won any deals yet no yeah how (07:33) soon will you win a deal I think next week all right well (07:36) talk next week so how much will that deal be worth then (07:42) assuming you do get this deal next week and that should be worth ten thousand (07:46) dollars and and what will be your costs behind (07:49) is that like pure profit for you uh that's like pure profit so it's our cost (07:54) is just like the men the people now why is this (07:59) why is this going to be like 100 billion dollar company (08:03) um so it's a huge market and so today (08:08) like the the amount that these Traders spend on brokerage fees today is about (08:14) three billion and dollars at least at current market low rates (08:20) and the largest company today is a company called Clarkson's who (08:26) um make 240 million GBP and per annum and I mean (08:32) to me that also means like you have some really formidable competitors like are (08:36) they really just gonna roll over and let you take their business (08:39) uh well no I don't think they're gonna roll over but um (08:42) so I think what's kind of what's interesting that's happening is that (08:47) the problem with these big guys like they are superior to the small Brokers (08:51) right they have more intelligence and they can serve bigger clients better (08:55) but who they can't serve is the little guys (08:59) um and they can't serve them because it's so manual with all their processes (09:04) so so basically you're thinking you're gonna come in at the bottom of the (09:08) market where they're just totally neglected yeah is that who you're going (09:11) after right now is that who this first customer is is that at the bottom of the (09:14) market um no we we 've been starting at the (09:17) bottom Market but actually a lot of the big just want to talk to us too because (09:21) of the superior intelligence that we can actually leverage free data but but I (09:26) mean if if there is this bottom of the market that's totally neglected why not (09:29) because you haven't done any ships yet right like why not just go find some of (09:33) these guys who are super neglected no we we're all working with those as well (09:39) so is this it seems like I see a lot of startups (09:43) where they're basically the high level pitch is there's these Brokers that make (09:47) a lot of money and we're going to cut them out with technology and take all (09:51) the money um but I mean just as a general form (09:54) like the most uh yeah obvious for me and familiar to most (09:58) of us is like the real estate market right like Redfin or someone was going (10:01) to come in and just blow away the Brokers but so far it seems like I don't (10:05) know if I've seen any of that those markets it seems like the Brokers are (10:08) very good at holding on to their position so the key key thing in this (10:13) market I mean I mean there's one thing to say that we still have Brokers and so (10:17) we're not a pure technology play We're enabling our Brokers to be much smarter (10:21) than anyone else and the cool thing about this Market is that (10:25) um intelligence is the main driver uh Traders reward their Brokers with deals (10:31) based on intelligence because you need that intelligence to keep getting good (10:35) rates so if\"}",

accident a couple of years ago one of our (00:20) speakers had to cancel at the last minute so we just threw together this (00:24) idea let's bring up some startups this is NYC we've never done it on stage (00:29) before but the idea was you know a lot of people they've gone through YC (00:34) it's coming up to demo day and actually they've never had a real experience like (00:39) pitching an investor just like cold someone who doesn't know anything about (00:43) them um so we got this idea hey let's just (00:46) try it out uh you know have a Founder come up give their pitch (00:51) and just to warn you they're usually like pretty rough that's kind of the (00:55) point of it and then we have a partner in this case it'll be Sam come repitch (01:00) the business and hopefully he does a smoother job (01:05) we'll see um (01:07) a few things to keep in mind this will be a little bit like the office hours (01:10) except not at all helpful and um probably uh maybe a little bit more uh (01:19) brutal so just to kind of give you some context like as a seed investor (01:25) um something you have to keep in mind is that the median startup is ultimately (01:29) worth about zero dollars um and probably 95 percent of startups (01:35) are a bad investment so you kind of get in a mode where (01:39) you're just a default no right and it's a very it's a little bit cold because (01:44) you know people are pouring off their hearts and they're preparing all their (01:47) dreams into it but uh you know nine times out of (01:54) uh out of a thousand probably um no the other way around anyway it's always if (01:59) you have to say no a lot um and so when you when you when you see a business (02:04) um what you're looking for is like why are you the exception right so it's not (02:07) good enough just to be like oh that sounds like a nice business I have to (02:11) think like wow this is that one business that one that I've been saying no for (02:15) months but today I'm going to say yes so just to just to kind of frame it for you (02:19) all right uh first up let's give a round of applause (02:31) let's see also just for context I don't know (02:38) anything so uh I'm not actually pretending that I didn't bother to learn (02:43) anything so this is I'm hearing about the business for the first time so okay (02:49) yeah launch in okay introduce yourself so (02:54) uh agricultural energy and mining companies uh higher ships and just to be (03:01) clear I'm not talking about containers I'm talking about full ships (03:07) Okay so you do something with ships I got that (03:11) part um (03:13) so this is like if I need to go rent is this like a rental like I need to go (03:17) rent so you are a commodity Trader you need to shift 50 000 tons of coal from (03:24) South Africa to Rotterdam and you come to us to find that ship I see so I took (03:29) a position on coal in South Africa and then (03:33) get it someplace else and what would I do today well I don't know anything (03:38) about this business so today you would pick up your phone and your email and (03:43) you would call five to ten Brokers and say hey I need to move this stuff (03:48) I see so this is like a marketplace where right now these Brokers and they (03:52) what do they take a big cut and then you're gonna like what's the value (03:55) proposition for me as as a Trader so think (04:00) I think you're speaking to all these different Brokers and it can take you (04:04) three to 24 hours to get some indications back it can take you (04:07) um up to two weeks and to actually book that ship uh with shipper Max we use (04:12) satellite technology and navigation and to cover every ship on Earth and we can (04:18) tell you which ship can make it in time and fit the specifications and is open (04:22) in seconds okay so is the idea that it's just (04:26) easier for me or do I get a better price like what's what closes the deal so this (04:32) there's two things when you think about trading one it's like a a very binary (04:36) thing as a commodity Trader and you need to know what your delivered price is and (04:42) to the customer otherwise someone else can come come and get that deal instead (04:46) of you and both myself and my co-founder have lost multi-million pound deals for (04:51) not getting Freight fast enough and and the second proposition is really (04:56) um service would you rather uh speak to five Brokers and receive thousands of (05:01) emails for a per deal or would you rather say this is my let's go (05:07) uh the letter sounds better I'm not in that position so so do you have a lot of (05:13) traction I mean are you what's your growth rate so we launched um about uh (05:17) our beta about seven weeks ago and since then what we were trying to do is talk (05:22) to these charterers these Traders and to see if they would talk to us and give us (05:26) requests and to date we've had about 4.5 million worth of gross and (05:32) um last week was um a great win for us because we signed one of the uh largest (05:38) energy trading companies in the world they shift 150 million and tons of (05:43) products annually and what does that deal represent for (05:46) you how much revenue are you going to make off of that so it's we're still (05:50) competing with other Brokers right now the revenue potential was 15 million (05:54) annually so we're now receiving those requests to compete on a deal by deal (05:58) basis to be faster and better so from their perspective you're just another (06:02) broker is that right yeah right they don't even know that you're like a tech (06:05) company they're just like oh new broker yeah is that good or bad for you (06:10) um so we're kind of edging are we in the way I've started this conversation (06:14) is saying like hey um our goal is to make this much much (06:19) faster like help us get there and so they're giving us a go they want smarter (06:24) intelligence and the smaller companies want better access to the market (06:29) um so today we're just saying yeah it's not all perfect out of the box right now (06:34) but um give us a go we're not worse than the (06:37) other Brokers have they used you yet or do they just say well think about you no (06:41) yeah they they they're giving us requests too so how many ships have you (06:45) shipped we haven't shipped in right now we've basically been getting those (06:49) requests which was our first test to see will they give them to us because that's (06:53) actually quite a big deal because they're telling you Market information (06:57) and does that mean that they're sending you the request but then they're going (07:00) with a different broker um right now basically what our problem (07:05) has been is that we (07:08) um need a bit more funding to get uh more men on the ground to help fulfill (07:13) these requests and because right now some of the larger brokers (07:18) have better intelligence and so we're starting kind of from zero and each time (07:25) um we're kind of getting closer and closer to actually booking that deal and (07:28) beating the brokers so you haven't actually won any deals yet no yeah how (07:33) soon will you win a deal I think next week all right well (07:36) talk next week so how much will that deal be worth then (07:42) assuming you do get this deal next week and that should be worth ten thousand (07:46) dollars and and what will be your costs behind (07:49) is that like pure profit for you uh that's like pure profit so it's our cost (07:54) is just like the men the people now why is this (07:59) why is this going to be like 100 billion dollar company (08:03) um so it's a huge market and so today (08:08) like the the amount that these Traders spend on brokerage fees today is about (08:14) three billion and dollars at least at current market low rates (08:20) and the largest company today is a company called Clarkson's who (08:26) um make 240 million GBP and per annum and I mean (08:32) to me that also means like you have some really formidable competitors like are (08:36) they really just gonna roll over and let you take their business (08:39) uh well no I don't think they're gonna roll over but um (08:42) so I think what's kind of what's interesting that's happening is that (08:47) the problem with these big guys like they are superior to the small Brokers (08:51) right they have more intelligence and they can serve bigger clients better (08:55) but who they can't serve is the little guys (08:59) um and they can't serve them because it's so manual with all their processes (09:04) so so basically you're thinking you're gonna come in at the bottom of the (09:08) market where they're just totally neglected yeah is that who you're going (09:11) after right now is that who this first customer is is that at the bottom of the (09:14) market um no we we 've been starting at the (09:17) bottom Market but actually a lot of the big just want to talk to us too because (09:21) of the superior intelligence that we can actually leverage free data but but I (09:26) mean if if there is this bottom of the market that's totally neglected why not (09:29) because you haven't done any ships yet right like why not just go find some of (09:33) these guys who are super neglected no we we're all working with those as well (09:39) so is this it seems like I see a lot of startups (09:43) where they're basically the high level pitch is there's these Brokers that make (09:47) a lot of money and we're going to cut them out with technology and take all (09:51) the money um but I mean just as a general form (09:54) like the most uh yeah obvious for me and familiar to most (09:58) of us is like the real estate market right like Redfin or someone was going (10:01) to come in and just blow away the Brokers but so far it seems like I don't (10:05) know if I've seen any of that those markets it seems like the Brokers are (10:08) very good at holding on to their position so the key key thing in this (10:13) market I mean I mean there's one thing to say that we still have Brokers and so (10:17) we're not a pure technology play We're enabling our Brokers to be much smarter (10:21) than anyone else and the cool thing about this Market is that (10:25) um intelligence is the main driver uh Traders reward their Brokers with deals (10:31) based on intelligence because you need that intelligence to keep getting good (10:35) rates so if\"}",

accident a couple of years ago one of our (00:20) speakers had to cancel at the last minute so we just threw together this (00:24) idea let's bring up some startups this is NYC we've never done it on stage (00:29) before but the idea was you know a lot of people they've gone through YC (00:34) it's coming up to demo day and actually they've never had a real experience like (00:39) pitching an investor just like cold someone who doesn't know anything about (00:43) them um so we got this idea hey let's just (00:46) try it out uh you know have a Founder come up give their pitch (00:51) and just to warn you they're usually like pretty rough that's kind of the (00:55) point of it and then we have a partner in this case it'll be Sam come repitch (01:00) the business and hopefully he does a smoother job (01:05) we'll see um (01:07) a few things to keep in mind this will be a little bit like the office hours (01:10) except not at all helpful and um probably uh maybe a little bit more uh (01:19) brutal so just to kind of give you some context like as a seed investor (01:25) um something you have to keep in mind is that the median startup is ultimately (01:29) worth about zero dollars um and probably 95 percent of startups (01:35) are a bad investment so you kind of get in a mode where (01:39) you're just a default no right and it's a very it's a little bit cold because (01:44) you know people are pouring off their hearts and they're preparing all their (01:47) dreams into it but uh you know nine times out of (01:54) uh out of a thousand probably um no the other way around anyway it's always if (01:59) you have to say no a lot um and so when you when you when you see a business (02:04) um what you're looking for is like why are you the exception right so it's not (02:07) good enough just to be like oh that sounds like a nice business I have to (02:11) think like wow this is that one business that one that I've been saying no for (02:15) months but today I'm going to say yes so just to just to kind of frame it for you (02:19) all right uh first up let's give a round of applause (02:31) let's see also just for context I don't know (02:38) anything so uh I'm not actually pretending that I didn't bother to learn (02:43) anything so this is I'm hearing about the business for the first time so okay (02:49) yeah launch in okay introduce yourself so (02:54) uh agricultural energy and mining companies uh higher ships and just to be (03:01) clear I'm not talking about containers I'm talking about full ships (03:07) Okay so you do something with ships I got that (03:11) part um (03:13) so this is like if I need to go rent is this like a rental like I need to go (03:17) rent so you are a commodity Trader you need to shift 50 000 tons of coal from (03:24) South Africa to Rotterdam and you come to us to find that ship I see so I took (03:29) a position on coal in South Africa and then (03:33) get it someplace else and what would I do today well I don't know anything (03:38) about this business so today you would pick up your phone and your email and (03:43) you would call five to ten Brokers and say hey I need to move this stuff (03:48) I see so this is like a marketplace where right now these Brokers and they (03:52) what do they take a big cut and then you're gonna like what's the value (03:55) proposition for me as as a Trader so think (04:00) I think you're speaking to all these different Brokers and it can take you (04:04) three to 24 hours to get some indications back it can take you (04:07) um up to two weeks and to actually book that ship uh with shipper Max we use (04:12) satellite technology and navigation and to cover every ship on Earth and we can (04:18) tell you which ship can make it in time and fit the specifications and is open (04:22) in seconds okay so is the idea that it's just (04:26) easier for me or do I get a better price like what's what closes the deal so this (04:32) there's two things when you think about trading one it's like a a very binary (04:36) thing as a commodity Trader and you need to know what your delivered price is and (04:42) to the customer otherwise someone else can come come and get that deal instead (04:46) of you and both myself and my co-founder have lost multi-million pound deals for (04:51) not getting Freight fast enough and and the second proposition is really (04:56) um service would you rather uh speak to five Brokers and receive thousands of (05:01) emails for a per deal or would you rather say this is my let's go (05:07) uh the letter sounds better I'm not in that position so so do you have a lot of (05:13) traction I mean are you what's your growth rate so we launched um about uh (05:17) our beta about seven weeks ago and since then what we were trying to do is talk (05:22) to these charterers these Traders and to see if they would talk to us and give us (05:26) requests and to date we've had about 4.5 million worth of gross and (05:32) um last week was um a great win for us because we signed one of the uh largest (05:38) energy trading companies in the world they shift 150 million and tons of (05:43) products annually and what does that deal represent for (05:46) you how much revenue are you going to make off of that so it's we're still (05:50) competing with other Brokers right now the revenue potential was 15 million (05:54) annually so we're now receiving those requests to compete on a deal by deal (05:58) basis to be faster and better so from their perspective you're just another (06:02) broker is that right yeah right they don't even know that you're like a tech (06:05) company they're just like oh new broker yeah is that good or bad for you (06:10) um so we're kind of edging are we in the way I've started this conversation (06:14) is saying like hey um our goal is to make this much much (06:19) faster like help us get there and so they're giving us a go they want smarter (06:24) intelligence and the smaller companies want better access to the market (06:29) um so today we're just saying yeah it's not all perfect out of the box right now (06:34) but um give us a go we're not worse than the (06:37) other Brokers have they used you yet or do they just say well think about you no (06:41) yeah they they they're giving us requests too so how many ships have you (06:45) shipped we haven't shipped in right now we've basically been getting those (06:49) requests which was our first test to see will they give them to us because that's (06:53) actually quite a big deal because they're telling you Market information (06:57) and does that mean that they're sending you the request but then they're going (07:00) with a different broker um right now basically what our problem (07:05) has been is that we (07:08) um need a bit more funding to get uh more men on the ground to help fulfill (07:13) these requests and because right now some of the larger brokers (07:18) have better intelligence and so we're starting kind of from zero and each time (07:25) um we're kind of getting closer and closer to actually booking that deal and (07:28) beating the brokers so you haven't actually won any deals yet no yeah how (07:33) soon will you win a deal I think next week all right well (07:36) talk next week so how much will that deal be worth then (07:42) assuming you do get this deal next week and that should be worth ten thousand (07:46) dollars and and what will be your costs behind (07:49) is that like pure profit for you uh that's like pure profit so it's our cost (07:54) is just like the men the people now why is this (07:59) why is this going to be like 100 billion dollar company (08:03) um so it's a huge market and so today (08:08) like the the amount that these Traders spend on brokerage fees today is about (08:14) three billion and dollars at least at current market low rates (08:20) and the largest company today is a company called Clarkson's who (08:26) um make 240 million GBP and per annum and I mean (08:32) to me that also means like you have some really formidable competitors like are (08:36) they really just gonna roll over and let you take their business (08:39) uh well no I don't think they're gonna roll over but um (08:42) so I think what's kind of what's interesting that's happening is that (08:47) the problem with these big guys like they are superior to the small Brokers (08:51) right they have more intelligence and they can serve bigger clients better (08:55) but who they can't serve is the little guys (08:59) um and they can't serve them because it's so manual with all their processes (09:04) so so basically you're thinking you're gonna come in at the bottom of the (09:08) market where they're just totally neglected yeah is that who you're going (09:11) after right now is that who this first customer is is that at the bottom of the (09:14) market um no we we 've been starting at the (09:17) bottom Market but actually a lot of the big just want to talk to us too because (09:21) of the superior intelligence that we can actually leverage free data but but I (09:26) mean if if there is this bottom of the market that's totally neglected why not (09:29) because you haven't done any ships yet right like why not just go find some of (09:33) these guys who are super neglected no we we're all working with those as well (09:39) so is this it seems like I see a lot of startups (09:43) where they're basically the high level pitch is there's these Brokers that make (09:47) a lot of money and we're going to cut them out with technology and take all (09:51) the money um but I mean just as a general form (09:54) like the most uh yeah obvious for me and familiar to most (09:58) of us is like the real estate market right like Redfin or someone was going (10:01) to come in and just blow away the Brokers but so far it seems like I don't (10:05) know if I've seen any of that those markets it seems like the Brokers are (10:08) very good at holding on to their position so the key key thing in this (10:13) market I mean I mean there's one thing to say that we still have Brokers and so (10:17) we're not a pure technology play We're enabling our Brokers to be much smarter (10:21) than anyone else and the cool thing about this Market is that (10:25) um intelligence is the main driver uh Traders reward their Brokers with deals (10:31) based on intelligence because you need that intelligence to keep getting good (10:35) rates so if\"}",

accident a couple of years ago one of our (00:20) speakers had to cancel at the last minute so we just threw together this (00:24) idea let's bring up some startups this is NYC we've never done it on stage (00:29) before but the idea was you know a lot of people they've gone through YC (00:34) it's coming up to demo day and actually they've never had a real experience like (00:39) pitching an investor just like cold someone who doesn't know anything about (00:43) them um so we got this idea hey let's just (00:46) try it out uh you know have a Founder come up give their pitch (00:51) and just to warn you they're usually like pretty rough that's kind of the (00:55) point of it and then we have a partner in this case it'll be Sam come repitch (01:00) the business and hopefully he does a smoother job (01:05) we'll see um (01:07) a few things to keep in mind this will be a little bit like the office hours (01:10) except not at all helpful and um probably uh maybe a little bit more uh (01:19) brutal so just to kind of give you some context like as a seed investor (01:25) um something you have to keep in mind is that the median startup is ultimately (01:29) worth about zero dollars um and probably 95 percent of startups (01:35) are a bad investment so you kind of get in a mode where (01:39) you're just a default no right and it's a very it's a little bit cold because (01:44) you know people are pouring off their hearts and they're preparing all their (01:47) dreams into it but uh you know nine times out of (01:54) uh out of a thousand probably um no the other way around anyway it's always if (01:59) you have to say no a lot um and so when you when you when you see a business (02:04) um what you're looking for is like why are you the exception right so it's not (02:07) good enough just to be like oh that sounds like a nice business I have to (02:11) think like wow this is that one business that one that I've been saying no for (02:15) months but today I'm going to say yes so just to just to kind of frame it for you (02:19) all right uh first up let's give a round of applause (02:31) let's see also just for context I don't know (02:38) anything so uh I'm not actually pretending that I didn't bother to learn (02:43) anything so this is I'm hearing about the business for the first time so okay (02:49) yeah launch in okay introduce yourself so (02:54) uh agricultural energy and mining companies uh higher ships and just to be (03:01) clear I'm not talking about containers I'm talking about full ships (03:07) Okay so you do something with ships I got that (03:11) part um (03:13) so this is like if I need to go rent is this like a rental like I need to go (03:17) rent so you are a commodity Trader you need to shift 50 000 tons of coal from (03:24) South Africa to Rotterdam and you come to us to find that ship I see so I took (03:29) a position on coal in South Africa and then (03:33) get it someplace else and what would I do today well I don't know anything (03:38) about this business so today you would pick up your phone and your email and (03:43) you would call five to ten Brokers and say hey I need to move this stuff (03:48) I see so this is like a marketplace where right now these Brokers and they (03:52) what do they take a big cut and then you're gonna like what's the value (03:55) proposition for me as as a Trader so think (04:00) I think you're speaking to all these different Brokers and it can take you (04:04) three to 24 hours to get some indications back it can take you (04:07) um up to two weeks and to actually book that ship uh with shipper Max we use (04:12) satellite technology and navigation and to cover every ship on Earth and we can (04:18) tell you which ship can make it in time and fit the specifications and is open (04:22) in seconds okay so is the idea that it's just (04:26) easier for me or do I get a better price like what's what closes the deal so this (04:32) there's two things when you think about trading one it's like a a very binary (04:36) thing as a commodity Trader and you need to know what your delivered price is and (04:42) to the customer otherwise someone else can come come and get that deal instead (04:46) of you and both myself and my co-founder have lost multi-million pound deals for (04:51) not getting Freight fast enough and and the second proposition is really (04:56) um service would you rather uh speak to five Brokers and receive thousands of (05:01) emails for a per deal or would you rather say this is my let's go (05:07) uh the letter sounds better I'm not in that position so so do you have a lot of (05:13) traction I mean are you what's your growth rate so we launched um about uh (05:17) our beta about seven weeks ago and since then what we were trying to do is talk (05:22) to these charterers these Traders and to see if they would talk to us and give us (05:26) requests and to date we've had about 4.5 million worth of gross and (05:32) um last week was um a great win for us because we signed one of the uh largest (05:38) energy trading companies in the world they shift 150 million and tons of (05:43) products annually and what does that deal represent for (05:46) you how much revenue are you going to make off of that so it's we're still (05:50) competing with other Brokers right now the revenue potential was 15 million (05:54) annually so we're now receiving those requests to compete on a deal by deal (05:58) basis to be faster and better so from their perspective you're just another (06:02) broker is that right yeah right they don't even know that you're like a tech (06:05) company they're just like oh new broker yeah is that good or bad for you (06:10) um so we're kind of edging are we in the way I've started this conversation (06:14) is saying like hey um our goal is to make this much much (06:19) faster like help us get there and so they're giving us a go they want smarter (06:24) intelligence and the smaller companies want better access to the market (06:29) um so today we're just saying yeah it's not all perfect out of the box right now (06:34) but um give us a go we're not worse than the (06:37) other Brokers have they used you yet or do they just say well think about you no (06:41) yeah they they they're giving us requests too so how many ships have you (06:45) shipped we haven't shipped in right now we've basically been getting those (06:49) requests which was our first test to see will they give them to us because that's (06:53) actually quite a big deal because they're telling you Market information (06:57) and does that mean that they're sending you the request but then they're going (07:00) with a different broker um right now basically what our problem (07:05) has been is that we (07:08) um need a bit more funding to get uh more men on the ground to help fulfill (07:13) these requests and because right now some of the larger brokers (07:18) have better intelligence and so we're starting kind of from zero and each time (07:25) um we're kind of getting closer and closer to actually booking that deal and (07:28) beating the brokers so you haven't actually won any deals yet no yeah how (07:33) soon will you win a deal I think next week all right well (07:36) talk next week so how much will that deal be worth then (07:42) assuming you do get this deal next week and that should be worth ten thousand (07:46) dollars and and what will be your costs behind (07:49) is that like pure profit for you uh that's like pure profit so it's our cost (07:54) is just like the men the people now why is this (07:59) why is this going to be like 100 billion dollar company (08:03) um so it's a huge market and so today (08:08) like the the amount that these Traders spend on brokerage fees today is about (08:14) three billion and dollars at least at current market low rates (08:20) and the largest company today is a company called Clarkson's who (08:26) um make 240 million GBP and per annum and I mean (08:32) to me that also means like you have some really formidable competitors like are (08:36) they really just gonna roll over and let you take their business (08:39) uh well no I don't think they're gonna roll over but um (08:42) so I think what's kind of what's interesting that's happening is that (08:47) the problem with these big guys like they are superior to the small Brokers (08:51) right they have more intelligence and they can serve bigger clients better (08:55) but who they can't serve is the little guys (08:59) um and they can't serve them because it's so manual with all their processes (09:04) so so basically you're thinking you're gonna come in at the bottom of the (09:08) market where they're just totally neglected yeah is that who you're going (09:11) after right now is that who this first customer is is that at the bottom of the (09:14) market um no we we 've been starting at the (09:17) bottom Market but actually a lot of the big just want to talk to us too because (09:21) of the superior intelligence that we can actually leverage free data but but I (09:26) mean if if there is this bottom of the market that's totally neglected why not (09:29) because you haven't done any ships yet right like why not just go find some of (09:33) these guys who are super neglected no we we're all working with those as well (09:39) so is this it seems like I see a lot of startups (09:43) where they're basically the high level pitch is there's these Brokers that make (09:47) a lot of money and we're going to cut them out with technology and take all (09:51) the money um but I mean just as a general form (09:54) like the most uh yeah obvious for me and familiar to most (09:58) of us is like the real estate market right like Redfin or someone was going (10:01) to come in and just blow away the Brokers but so far it seems like I don't (10:05) know if I've seen any of that those markets it seems like the Brokers are (10:08) very good at holding on to their position so the key key thing in this (10:13) market I mean I mean there's one thing to say that we still have Brokers and so (10:17) we're not a pure technology play We're enabling our Brokers to be much smarter (10:21) than anyone else and the cool thing about this Market is that (10:25) um intelligence is the main driver uh Traders reward their Brokers with deals (10:31) based on intelligence because you need that intelligence to keep getting good (10:35) rates so if\"}",

accident a couple of years ago one of our (00:20) speakers had to cancel at the last minute so we just threw together this (00:24) idea let's bring up some startups this is NYC we've never done it on stage (00:29) before but the idea was you know a lot of people they've gone through YC (00:34) it's coming up to demo day and actually they've never had a real experience like (00:39) pitching an investor just like cold someone who doesn't know anything about (00:43) them um so we got this idea hey let's just (00:46) try it out uh you know have a Founder come up give their pitch (00:51) and just to warn you they're usually like pretty rough that's kind of the (00:55) point of it and then we have a partner in this case it'll be Sam come repitch (01:00) the business and hopefully he does a smoother job (01:05) we'll see um (01:07) a few things to keep in mind this will be a little bit like the office hours (01:10) except not at all helpful and um probably uh maybe a little bit more uh (01:19) brutal so just to kind of give you some context like as a seed investor (01:25) um something you have to keep in mind is that the median startup is ultimately (01:29) worth about zero dollars um and probably 95 percent of startups (01:35) are a bad investment so you kind of get in a mode where (01:39) you're just a default no right and it's a very it's a little bit cold because (01:44) you know people are pouring off their hearts and they're preparing all their (01:47) dreams into it but uh you know nine times out of (01:54) uh out of a thousand probably um no the other way around anyway it's always if (01:59) you have to say no a lot um and so when you when you when you see a business (02:04) um what you're looking for is like why are you the exception right so it's not (02:07) good enough just to be like oh that sounds like a nice business I have to (02:11) think like wow this is that one business that one that I've been saying no for (02:15) months but today I'm going to say yes so just to just to kind of frame it for you (02:19) all right uh first up let's give a round of applause (02:31) let's see also just for context I don't know (02:38) anything so uh I'm not actually pretending that I didn't bother to learn (02:43) anything so this is I'm hearing about the business for the first time so okay (02:49) yeah launch in okay introduce yourself so (02:54) uh agricultural energy and mining companies uh higher ships and just to be (03:01) clear I'm not talking about containers I'm talking about full ships (03:07) Okay so you do something with ships I got that (03:11) part um (03:13) so this is like if I need to go rent is this like a rental like I need to go (03:17) rent so you are a commodity Trader you need to shift 50 000 tons of coal from (03:24) South Africa to Rotterdam and you come to us to find that ship I see so I took (03:29) a position on coal in South Africa and then (03:33) get it someplace else and what would I do today well I don't know anything (03:38) about this business so today you would pick up your phone and your email and (03:43) you would call five to ten Brokers and say hey I need to move this stuff (03:48) I see so this is like a marketplace where right now these Brokers and they (03:52) what do they take a big cut and then you're gonna like what's the value (03:55) proposition for me as as a Trader so think (04:00) I think you're speaking to all these different Brokers and it can take you (04:04) three to 24 hours to get some indications back it can take you (04:07) um up to two weeks and to actually book that ship uh with shipper Max we use (04:12) satellite technology and navigation and to cover every ship on Earth and we can (04:18) tell you which ship can make it in time and fit the specifications and is open (04:22) in seconds okay so is the idea that it's just (04:26) easier for me or do I get a better price like what's what closes the deal so this (04:32) there's two things when you think about trading one it's like a a very binary (04:36) thing as a commodity Trader and you need to know what your delivered price is and (04:42) to the customer otherwise someone else can come come and get that deal instead (04:46) of you and both myself and my co-founder have lost multi-million pound deals for (04:51) not getting Freight fast enough and and the second proposition is really (04:56) um service would you rather uh speak to five Brokers and receive thousands of (05:01) emails for a per deal or would you rather say this is my let's go (05:07) uh the letter sounds better I'm not in that position so so do you have a lot of (05:13) traction I mean are you what's your growth rate so we launched um about uh (05:17) our beta about seven weeks ago and since then what we were trying to do is talk (05:22) to these charterers these Traders and to see if they would talk to us and give us (05:26) requests and to date we've had about 4.5 million worth of gross and (05:32) um last week was um a great win for us because we signed one of the uh largest (05:38) energy trading companies in the world they shift 150 million and tons of (05:43) products annually and what does that deal represent for (05:46) you how much revenue are you going to make off of that so it's we're still (05:50) competing with other Brokers right now the revenue potential was 15 million (05:54) annually so we're now receiving those requests to compete on a deal by deal (05:58) basis to be faster and better so from their perspective you're just another (06:02) broker is that right yeah right they don't even know that you're like a tech (06:05) company they're just like oh new broker yeah is that good or bad for you (06:10) um so we're kind of edging are we in the way I've started this conversation (06:14) is saying like hey um our goal is to make this much much (06:19) faster like help us get there and so they're giving us a go they want smarter (06:24) intelligence and the smaller companies want better access to the market (06:29) um so today we're just saying yeah it's not all perfect out of the box right now (06:34) but um give us a go we're not worse than the (06:37) other Brokers have they used you yet or do they just say well think about you no (06:41) yeah they they they're giving us requests too so how many ships have you (06:45) shipped we haven't shipped in right now we've basically been getting those (06:49) requests which was our first test to see will they give them to us because that's (06:53) actually quite a big deal because they're telling you Market information (06:57) and does that mean that they're sending you the request but then they're going (07:00) with a different broker um right now basically what our problem (07:05) has been is that we (07:08) um need a bit more funding to get uh more men on the ground to help fulfill (07:13) these requests and because right now some of the larger brokers (07:18) have better intelligence and so we're starting kind of from zero and each time (07:25) um we're kind of getting closer and closer to actually booking that deal and (07:28) beating the brokers so you haven't actually won any deals yet no yeah how (07:33) soon will you win a deal I think next week all right well (07:36) talk next week so how much will that deal be worth then (07:42) assuming you do get this deal next week and that should be worth ten thousand (07:46) dollars and and what will be your costs behind (07:49) is that like pure profit for you uh that's like pure profit so it's our cost (07:54) is just like the men the people now why is this (07:59) why is this going to be like 100 billion dollar company (08:03) um so it's a huge market and so today (08:08) like the the amount that these Traders spend on brokerage fees today is about (08:14) three billion and dollars at least at current market low rates (08:20) and the largest company today is a company called Clarkson's who (08:26) um make 240 million GBP and per annum and I mean (08:32) to me that also means like you have some really formidable competitors like are (08:36) they really just gonna roll over and let you take their business (08:39) uh well no I don't think they're gonna roll over but um (08:42) so I think what's kind of what's interesting that's happening is that (08:47) the problem with these big guys like they are superior to the small Brokers (08:51) right they have more intelligence and they can serve bigger clients better (08:55) but who they can't serve is the little guys (08:59) um and they can't serve them because it's so manual with all their processes (09:04) so so basically you're thinking you're gonna come in at the bottom of the (09:08) market where they're just totally neglected yeah is that who you're going (09:11) after right now is that who this first customer is is that at the bottom of the (09:14) market um no we we 've been starting at the (09:17) bottom Market but actually a lot of the big just want to talk to us too because (09:21) of the superior intelligence that we can actually leverage free data but but I (09:26) mean if if there is this bottom of the market that's totally neglected why not (09:29) because you haven't done any ships yet right like why not just go find some of (09:33) these guys who are super neglected no we we're all working with those as well (09:39) so is this it seems like I see a lot of startups (09:43) where they're basically the high level pitch is there's these Brokers that make (09:47) a lot of money and we're going to cut them out with technology and take all (09:51) the money um but I mean just as a general form (09:54) like the most uh yeah obvious for me and familiar to most (09:58) of us is like the real estate market right like Redfin or someone was going (10:01) to come in and just blow away the Brokers but so far it seems like I don't (10:05) know if I've seen any of that those markets it seems like the Brokers are (10:08) very good at holding on to their position so the key key thing in this (10:13) market I mean I mean there's one thing to say that we still have Brokers and so (10:17) we're not a pure technology play We're enabling our Brokers to be much smarter (10:21) than anyone else and the cool thing about this Market is that (10:25) um intelligence is the main driver uh Traders reward their Brokers with deals (10:31) based on intelligence because you need that intelligence to keep getting good (10:35) rates so if\"}",

accident a couple of years ago one of our (00:20) speakers had to cancel at the last minute so we just threw together this (00:24) idea let's bring up some startups this is NYC we've never done it on stage (00:29) before but the idea was you know a lot of people they've gone through YC (00:34) it's coming up to demo day and actually they've never had a real experience like (00:39) pitching an investor just like cold someone who doesn't know anything about (00:43) them um so we got this idea hey let's just (00:46) try it out uh you know have a Founder come up give their pitch (00:51) and just to warn you they're usually like pretty rough that's kind of the (00:55) point of it and then we have a partner in this case it'll be Sam come repitch (01:00) the business and hopefully he does a smoother job (01:05) we'll see um (01:07) a few things to keep in mind this will be a little bit like the office hours (01:10) except not at all helpful and um probably uh maybe a little bit more uh (01:19) brutal so just to kind of give you some context like as a seed investor (01:25) um something you have to keep in mind is that the median startup is ultimately (01:29) worth about zero dollars um and probably 95 percent of startups (01:35) are a bad investment so you kind of get in a mode where (01:39) you're just a default no right and it's a very it's a little bit cold because (01:44) you know people are pouring off their hearts and they're preparing all their (01:47) dreams into it but uh you know nine times out of (01:54) uh out of a thousand probably um no the other way around anyway it's always if (01:59) you have to say no a lot um and so when you when you when you see a business (02:04) um what you're looking for is like why are you the exception right so it's not (02:07) good enough just to be like oh that sounds like a nice business I have to (02:11) think like wow this is that one business that one that I've been saying no for (02:15) months but today I'm going to say yes so just to just to kind of frame it for you (02:19) all right uh first up let's give a round of applause (02:31) let's see also just for context I don't know (02:38) anything so uh I'm not actually pretending that I didn't bother to learn (02:43) anything so this is I'm hearing about the business for the first time so okay (02:49) yeah launch in okay introduce yourself so (02:54) uh agricultural energy and mining companies uh higher ships and just to be (03:01) clear I'm not talking about containers I'm talking about full ships (03:07) Okay so you do something with ships I got that (03:11) part um (03:13) so this is like if I need to go rent is this like a rental like I need to go (03:17) rent so you are a commodity Trader you need to shift 50 000 tons of coal from (03:24) South Africa to Rotterdam and you come to us to find that ship I see so I took (03:29) a position on coal in South Africa and then (03:33) get it someplace else and what would I do today well I don't know anything (03:38) about this business so today you would pick up your phone and your email and (03:43) you would call five to ten Brokers and say hey I need to move this stuff (03:48) I see so this is like a marketplace where right now these Brokers and they (03:52) what do they take a big cut and then you're gonna like what's the value (03:55) proposition for me as as a Trader so think (04:00) I think you're speaking to all these different Brokers and it can take you (04:04) three to 24 hours to get some indications back it can take you (04:07) um up to two weeks and to actually book that ship uh with shipper Max we use (04:12) satellite technology and navigation and to cover every ship on Earth and we can (04:18) tell you which ship can make it in time and fit the specifications and is open (04:22) in seconds okay so is the idea that it's just (04:26) easier for me or do I get a better price like what's what closes the deal so this (04:32) there's two things when you think about trading one it's like a a very binary (04:36) thing as a commodity Trader and you need to know what your delivered price is and (04:42) to the customer otherwise someone else can come come and get that deal instead (04:46) of you and both myself and my co-founder have lost multi-million pound deals for (04:51) not getting Freight fast enough and and the second proposition is really (04:56) um service would you rather uh speak to five Brokers and receive thousands of (05:01) emails for a per deal or would you rather say this is my let's go (05:07) uh the letter sounds better I'm not in that position so so do you have a lot of (05:13) traction I mean are you what's your growth rate so we launched um about uh (05:17) our beta about seven weeks ago and since then what we were trying to do is talk (05:22) to these charterers these Traders and to see if they would talk to us and give us (05:26) requests and to date we've had about 4.5 million worth of gross and (05:32) um last week was um a great win for us because we signed one of the uh largest (05:38) energy trading companies in the world they shift 150 million and tons of (05:43) products annually and what does that deal represent for (05:46) you how much revenue are you going to make off of that so it's we're still (05:50) competing with other Brokers right now the revenue potential was 15 million (05:54) annually so we're now receiving those requests to compete on a deal by deal (05:58) basis to be faster and better so from their perspective you're just another (06:02) broker is that right yeah right they don't even know that you're like a tech (06:05) company they're just like oh new broker yeah is that good or bad for you (06:10) um so we're kind of edging are we in the way I've started this conversation (06:14) is saying like hey um our goal is to make this much much (06:19) faster like help us get there and so they're giving us a go they want smarter (06:24) intelligence and the smaller companies want better access to the market (06:29) um so today we're just saying yeah it's not all perfect out of the box right now (06:34) but um give us a go we're not worse than the (06:37) other Brokers have they used you yet or do they just say well think about you no (06:41) yeah they they they're giving us requests too so how many ships have you (06:45) shipped we haven't shipped in right now we've basically been getting those (06:49) requests which was our first test to see will they give them to us because that's (06:53) actually quite a big deal because they're telling you Market information (06:57) and does that mean that they're sending you the request but then they're going (07:00) with a different broker um right now basically what our problem (07:05) has been is that we (07:08) um need a bit more funding to get uh more men on the ground to help fulfill (07:13) these requests and because right now some of the larger brokers (07:18) have better intelligence and so we're starting kind of from zero and each time (07:25) um we're kind of getting closer and closer to actually booking that deal and (07:28) beating the brokers so you haven't actually won any deals yet no yeah how (07:33) soon will you win a deal I think next week all right well (07:36) talk next week so how much will that deal be worth then (07:42) assuming you do get this deal next week and that should be worth ten thousand (07:46) dollars and and what will be your costs behind (07:49) is that like pure profit for you uh that's like pure profit so it's our cost (07:54) is just like the men the people now why is this (07:59) why is this going to be like 100 billion dollar company (08:03) um so it's a huge market and so today (08:08) like the the amount that these Traders spend on brokerage fees today is about (08:14) three billion and dollars at least at current market low rates (08:20) and the largest company today is a company called Clarkson's who (08:26) um make 240 million GBP and per annum and I mean (08:32) to me that also means like you have some really formidable competitors like are (08:36) they really just gonna roll over and let you take their business (08:39) uh well no I don't think they're gonna roll over but um (08:42) so I think what's kind of what's interesting that's happening is that (08:47) the problem with these big guys like they are superior to the small Brokers (08:51) right they have more intelligence and they can serve bigger clients better (08:55) but who they can't serve is the little guys (08:59) um and they can't serve them because it's so manual with all their processes (09:04) so so basically you're thinking you're gonna come in at the bottom of the (09:08) market where they're just totally neglected yeah is that who you're going (09:11) after right now is that who this first customer is is that at the bottom of the (09:14) market um no we we 've been starting at the (09:17) bottom Market but actually a lot of the big just want to talk to us too because (09:21) of the superior intelligence that we can actually leverage free data but but I (09:26) mean if if there is this bottom of the market that's totally neglected why not (09:29) because you haven't done any ships yet right like why not just go find some of (09:33) these guys who are super neglected no we we're all working with those as well (09:39) so is this it seems like I see a lot of startups (09:43) where they're basically the high level pitch is there's these Brokers that make (09:47) a lot of money and we're going to cut them out with technology and take all (09:51) the money um but I mean just as a general form (09:54) like the most uh yeah obvious for me and familiar to most (09:58) of us is like the real estate market right like Redfin or someone was going (10:01) to come in and just blow away the Brokers but so far it seems like I don't (10:05) know if I've seen any of that those markets it seems like the Brokers are (10:08) very good at holding on to their position so the key key thing in this (10:13) market I mean I mean there's one thing to say that we still have Brokers and so (10:17) we're not a pure technology play We're enabling our Brokers to be much smarter (10:21) than anyone else and the cool thing about this Market is that (10:25) um intelligence is the main driver uh Traders reward their Brokers with deals (10:31) based on intelligence because you need that intelligence to keep getting good (10:35) rates so if\"}",

accident a couple of years ago one of our (00:20) speakers had to cancel at the last minute so we just threw together this (00:24) idea let's bring up some startups this is NYC we've never done it on stage (00:29) before but the idea was you know a lot of people they've gone through YC (00:34) it's coming up to demo day and actually they've never had a real experience like (00:39) pitching an investor just like cold someone who doesn't know anything about (00:43) them um so we got this idea hey let's just (00:46) try it out uh you know have a Founder come up give their pitch (00:51) and just to warn you they're usually like pretty rough that's kind of the (00:55) point of it and then we have a partner in this case it'll be Sam come repitch (01:00) the business and hopefully he does a smoother job (01:05) we'll see um (01:07) a few things to keep in mind this will be a little bit like the office hours (01:10) except not at all helpful and um probably uh maybe a little bit more uh (01:19) brutal so just to kind of give you some context like as a seed investor (01:25) um something you have to keep in mind is that the median startup is ultimately (01:29) worth about zero dollars um and probably 95 percent of startups (01:35) are a bad investment so you kind of get in a mode where (01:39) you're just a default no right and it's a very it's a little bit cold because (01:44) you know people are pouring off their hearts and they're preparing all their (01:47) dreams into it but uh you know nine times out of (01:54) uh out of a thousand probably um no the other way around anyway it's always if (01:59) you have to say no a lot um and so when you when you when you see a business (02:04) um what you're looking for is like why are you the exception right so it's not (02:07) good enough just to be like oh that sounds like a nice business I have to (02:11) think like wow this is that one business that one that I've been saying no for (02:15) months but today I'm going to say yes so just to just to kind of frame it for you (02:19) all right uh first up let's give a round of applause (02:31) let's see also just for context I don't know (02:38) anything so uh I'm not actually pretending that I didn't bother to learn (02:43) anything so this is I'm hearing about the business for the first time so okay (02:49) yeah launch in okay introduce yourself so (02:54) uh agricultural energy and mining companies uh higher ships and just to be (03:01) clear I'm not talking about containers I'm talking about full ships (03:07) Okay so you do something with ships I got that (03:11) part um (03:13) so this is like if I need to go rent is this like a rental like I need to go (03:17) rent so you are a commodity Trader you need to shift 50 000 tons of coal from (03:24) South Africa to Rotterdam and you come to us to find that ship I see so I took (03:29) a position on coal in South Africa and then (03:33) get it someplace else and what would I do today well I don't know anything (03:38) about this business so today you would pick up your phone and your email and (03:43) you would call five to ten Brokers and say hey I need to move this stuff (03:48) I see so this is like a marketplace where right now these Brokers and they (03:52) what do they take a big cut and then you're gonna like what's the value (03:55) proposition for me as as a Trader so think (04:00) I think you're speaking to all these different Brokers and it can take you (04:04) three to 24 hours to get some indications back it can take you (04:07) um up to two weeks and to actually book that ship uh with shipper Max we use (04:12) satellite technology and navigation and to cover every ship on Earth and we can (04:18) tell you which ship can make it in time and fit the specifications and is open (04:22) in seconds okay so is the idea that it's just (04:26) easier for me or do I get a better price like what's what closes the deal so this (04:32) there's two things when you think about trading one it's like a a very binary (04:36) thing as a commodity Trader and you need to know what your delivered price is and (04:42) to the customer otherwise someone else can come come and get that deal instead (04:46) of you and both myself and my co-founder have lost multi-million pound deals for (04:51) not getting Freight fast enough and and the second proposition is really (04:56) um service would you rather uh speak to five Brokers and receive thousands of (05:01) emails for a per deal or would you rather say this is my let's go (05:07) uh the letter sounds better I'm not in that position so so do you have a lot of (05:13) traction I mean are you what's your growth rate so we launched um about uh (05:17) our beta about seven weeks ago and since then what we were trying to do is talk (05:22) to these charterers these Traders and to see if they would talk to us and give us (05:26) requests and to date we've had about 4.5 million worth of gross and (05:32) um last week was um a great win for us because we signed one of the uh largest (05:38) energy trading companies in the world they shift 150 million and tons of (05:43) products annually and what does that deal represent for (05:46) you how much revenue are you going to make off of that so it's we're still (05:50) competing with other Brokers right now the revenue potential was 15 million (05:54) annually so we're now receiving those requests to compete on a deal by deal (05:58) basis to be faster and better so from their perspective you're just another (06:02) broker is that right yeah right they don't even know that you're like a tech (06:05) company they're just like oh new broker yeah is that good or bad for you (06:10) um so we're kind of edging are we in the way I've started this conversation (06:14) is saying like hey um our goal is to make this much much (06:19) faster like help us get there and so they're giving us a go they want smarter (06:24) intelligence and the smaller companies want better access to the market (06:29) um so today we're just saying yeah it's not all perfect out of the box right now (06:34) but um give us a go we're not worse than the (06:37) other Brokers have they used you yet or do they just say well think about you no (06:41) yeah they they they're giving us requests too so how many ships have you (06:45) shipped we haven't shipped in right now we've basically been getting those (06:49) requests which was our first test to see will they give them to us because that's (06:53) actually quite a big deal because they're telling you Market information (06:57) and does that mean that they're sending you the request but then they're going (07:00) with a different broker um right now basically what our problem (07:05) has been is that we (07:08) um need a bit more funding to get uh more men on the ground to help fulfill (07:13) these requests and because right now some of the larger brokers (07:18) have better intelligence and so we're starting kind of from zero and each time (07:25) um we're kind of getting closer and closer to actually booking that deal and (07:28) beating the brokers so you haven't actually won any deals yet no yeah how (07:33) soon will you win a deal I think next week all right well (07:36) talk next week so how much will that deal be worth then (07:42) assuming you do get this deal next week and that should be worth ten thousand (07:46) dollars and and what will be your costs behind (07:49) is that like pure profit for you uh that's like pure profit so it's our cost (07:54) is just like the men the people now why is this (07:59) why is this going to be like 100 billion dollar company (08:03) um so it's a huge market and so today (08:08) like the the amount that these Traders spend on brokerage fees today is about (08:14) three billion and dollars at least at current market low rates (08:20) and the largest company today is a company called Clarkson's who (08:26) um make 240 million GBP and per annum and I mean (08:32) to me that also means like you have some really formidable competitors like are (08:36) they really just gonna roll over and let you take their business (08:39) uh well no I don't think they're gonna roll over but um (08:42) so I think what's kind of what's interesting that's happening is that (08:47) the problem with these big guys like they are superior to the small Brokers (08:51) right they have more intelligence and they can serve bigger clients better (08:55) but who they can't serve is the little guys (08:59) um and they can't serve them because it's so manual with all their processes (09:04) so so basically you're thinking you're gonna come in at the bottom of the (09:08) market where they're just totally neglected yeah is that who you're going (09:11) after right now is that who this first customer is is that at the bottom of the (09:14) market um no we we 've been starting at the (09:17) bottom Market but actually a lot of the big just want to talk to us too because (09:21) of the superior intelligence that we can actually leverage free data but but I (09:26) mean if if there is this bottom of the market that's totally neglected why not (09:29) because you haven't done any ships yet right like why not just go find some of (09:33) these guys who are super neglected no we we're all working with those as well (09:39) so is this it seems like I see a lot of startups (09:43) where they're basically the high level pitch is there's these Brokers that make (09:47) a lot of money and we're going to cut them out with technology and take all (09:51) the money um but I mean just as a general form (09:54) like the most uh yeah obvious for me and familiar to most (09:58) of us is like the real estate market right like Redfin or someone was going (10:01) to come in and just blow away the Brokers but so far it seems like I don't (10:05) know if I've seen any of that those markets it seems like the Brokers are (10:08) very good at holding on to their position so the key key thing in this (10:13) market I mean I mean there's one thing to say that we still have Brokers and so (10:17) we're not a pure technology play We're enabling our Brokers to be much smarter (10:21) than anyone else and the cool thing about this Market is that (10:25) um intelligence is the main driver uh Traders reward their Brokers with deals (10:31) based on intelligence because you need that intelligence to keep getting good (10:35) rates so if\"}",

accident a couple of years ago one of our (00:20) speakers had to cancel at the last minute so we just threw together this (00:24) idea let's bring up some startups this is NYC we've never done it on stage (00:29) before but the idea was you know a lot of people they've gone through YC (00:34) it's coming up to demo day and actually they've never had a real experience like (00:39) pitching an investor just like cold someone who doesn't know anything about (00:43) them um so we got this idea hey let's just (00:46) try it out uh you know have a Founder come up give their pitch (00:51) and just to warn you they're usually like pretty rough that's kind of the (00:55) point of it and then we have a partner in this case it'll be Sam come repitch (01:00) the business and hopefully he does a smoother job (01:05) we'll see um (01:07) a few things to keep in mind this will be a little bit like the office hours (01:10) except not at all helpful and um probably uh maybe a little bit more uh (01:19) brutal so just to kind of give you some context like as a seed investor (01:25) um something you have to keep in mind is that the median startup is ultimately (01:29) worth about zero dollars um and probably 95 percent of startups (01:35) are a bad investment so you kind of get in a mode where (01:39) you're just a default no right and it's a very it's a little bit cold because (01:44) you know people are pouring off their hearts and they're preparing all their (01:47) dreams into it but uh you know nine times out of (01:54) uh out of a thousand probably um no the other way around anyway it's always if (01:59) you have to say no a lot um and so when you when you when you see a business (02:04) um what you're looking for is like why are you the exception right so it's not (02:07) good enough just to be like oh that sounds like a nice business I have to (02:11) think like wow this is that one business that one that I've been saying no for (02:15) months but today I'm going to say yes so just to just to kind of frame it for you (02:19) all right uh first up let's give a round of applause (02:31) let's see also just for context I don't know (02:38) anything so uh I'm not actually pretending that I didn't bother to learn (02:43) anything so this is I'm hearing about the business for the first time so okay (02:49) yeah launch in okay introduce yourself so (02:54) uh agricultural energy and mining companies uh higher ships and just to be (03:01) clear I'm not talking about containers I'm talking about full ships (03:07) Okay so you do something with ships I got that (03:11) part um (03:13) so this is like if I need to go rent is this like a rental like I need to go (03:17) rent so you are a commodity Trader you need to shift 50 000 tons of coal from (03:24) South Africa to Rotterdam and you come to us to find that ship I see so I took (03:29) a position on coal in South Africa and then (03:33) get it someplace else and what would I do today well I don't know anything (03:38) about this business so today you would pick up your phone and your email and (03:43) you would call five to ten Brokers and say hey I need to move this stuff (03:48) I see so this is like a marketplace where right now these Brokers and they (03:52) what do they take a big cut and then you're gonna like what's the value (03:55) proposition for me as as a Trader so think (04:00) I think you're speaking to all these different Brokers and it can take you (04:04) three to 24 hours to get some indications back it can take you (04:07) um up to two weeks and to actually book that ship uh with shipper Max we use (04:12) satellite technology and navigation and to cover every ship on Earth and we can (04:18) tell you which ship can make it in time and fit the specifications and is open (04:22) in seconds okay so is the idea that it's just (04:26) easier for me or do I get a better price like what's what closes the deal so this (04:32) there's two things when you think about trading one it's like a a very binary (04:36) thing as a commodity Trader and you need to know what your delivered price is and (04:42) to the customer otherwise someone else can come come and get that deal instead (04:46) of you and both myself and my co-founder have lost multi-million pound deals for (04:51) not getting Freight fast enough and and the second proposition is really (04:56) um service would you rather uh speak to five Brokers and receive thousands of (05:01) emails for a per deal or would you rather say this is my let's go (05:07) uh the letter sounds better I'm not in that position so so do you have a lot of (05:13) traction I mean are you what's your growth rate so we launched um about uh (05:17) our beta about seven weeks ago and since then what we were trying to do is talk (05:22) to these charterers these Traders and to see if they would talk to us and give us (05:26) requests and to date we've had about 4.5 million worth of gross and (05:32) um last week was um a great win for us because we signed one of the uh largest (05:38) energy trading companies in the world they shift 150 million and tons of (05:43) products annually and what does that deal represent for (05:46) you how much revenue are you going to make off of that so it's we're still (05:50) competing with other Brokers right now the revenue potential was 15 million (05:54) annually so we're now receiving those requests to compete on a deal by deal (05:58) basis to be faster and better so from their perspective you're just another (06:02) broker is that right yeah right they don't even know that you're like a tech (06:05) company they're just like oh new broker yeah is that good or bad for you (06:10) um so we're kind of edging are we in the way I've started this conversation (06:14) is saying like hey um our goal is to make this much much (06:19) faster like help us get there and so they're giving us a go they want smarter (06:24) intelligence and the smaller companies want better access to the market (06:29) um so today we're just saying yeah it's not all perfect out of the box right now (06:34) but um give us a go we're not worse than the (06:37) other Brokers have they used you yet or do they just say well think about you no (06:41) yeah they they they're giving us requests too so how many ships have you (06:45) shipped we haven't shipped in right now we've basically been getting those (06:49) requests which was our first test to see will they give them to us because that's (06:53) actually quite a big deal because they're telling you Market information (06:57) and does that mean that they're sending you the request but then they're going (07:00) with a different broker um right now basically what our problem (07:05) has been is that we (07:08) um need a bit more funding to get uh more men on the ground to help fulfill (07:13) these requests and because right now some of the larger brokers (07:18) have better intelligence and so we're starting kind of from zero and each time (07:25) um we're kind of getting closer and closer to actually booking that deal and (07:28) beating the brokers so you haven't actually won any deals yet no yeah how (07:33) soon will you win a deal I think next week all right well (07:36) talk next week so how much will that deal be worth then (07:42) assuming you do get this deal next week and that should be worth ten thousand (07:46) dollars and and what will be your costs behind (07:49) is that like pure profit for you uh that's like pure profit so it's our cost (07:54) is just like the men the people now why is this (07:59) why is this going to be like 100 billion dollar company (08:03) um so it's a huge market and so today (08:08) like the the amount that these Traders spend on brokerage fees today is about (08:14) three billion and dollars at least at current market low rates (08:20) and the largest company today is a company called Clarkson's who (08:26) um make 240 million GBP and per annum and I mean (08:32) to me that also means like you have some really formidable competitors like are (08:36) they really just gonna roll over and let you take their business (08:39) uh well no I don't think they're gonna roll over but um (08:42) so I think what's kind of what's interesting that's happening is that (08:47) the problem with these big guys like they are superior to the small Brokers (08:51) right they have more intelligence and they can serve bigger clients better (08:55) but who they can't serve is the little guys (08:59) um and they can't serve them because it's so manual with all their processes (09:04) so so basically you're thinking you're gonna come in at the bottom of the (09:08) market where they're just totally neglected yeah is that who you're going (09:11) after right now is that who this first customer is is that at the bottom of the (09:14) market um no we we 've been starting at the (09:17) bottom Market but actually a lot of the big just want to talk to us too because (09:21) of the superior intelligence that we can actually leverage free data but but I (09:26) mean if if there is this bottom of the market that's totally neglected why not (09:29) because you haven't done any ships yet right like why not just go find some of (09:33) these guys who are super neglected no we we're all working with those as well (09:39) so is this it seems like I see a lot of startups (09:43) where they're basically the high level pitch is there's these Brokers that make (09:47) a lot of money and we're going to cut them out with technology and take all (09:51) the money um but I mean just as a general form (09:54) like the most uh yeah obvious for me and familiar to most (09:58) of us is like the real estate market right like Redfin or someone was going (10:01) to come in and just blow away the Brokers but so far it seems like I don't (10:05) know if I've seen any of that those markets it seems like the Brokers are (10:08) very good at holding on to their position so the key key thing in this (10:13) market I mean I mean there's one thing to say that we still have Brokers and so (10:17) we're not a pure technology play We're enabling our Brokers to be much smarter (10:21) than anyone else and the cool thing about this Market is that (10:25) um intelligence is the main driver uh Traders reward their Brokers with deals (10:31) based on intelligence because you need that intelligence to keep getting good (10:35) rates so if\"}",

stage (00:29) before but the idea was you know a lot of people they've gone through YC (00:34) it's coming up to demo day and actually they've never had a real experience like (00:39) pitching an investor just like cold someone who doesn't know anything about (00:43) them um so we got this idea hey let's just (00:46) try it out uh you know have a Founder come up give their pitch (00:51) and just to warn you they're usually like pretty rough that's kind of the (00:55) point of it and then we have a partner in this case it'll be Sam come repitch (01:00) the business and hopefully he does a smoother job (01:05) we'll see um (01:07) a few things to keep in mind this will be a little bit like the office hours (01:10) except not at all helpful and um probably uh maybe a little bit more uh (01:19) brutal so just to kind of give you some context like as a seed investor (01:25) um something you have to keep in mind is that the median startup is ultimately (01:29) worth about zero dollars um and probably 95 percent of startups (01:35) are a bad investment so you kind of get in a mode where (01:39) you're just a default no right and it's a very it's a little bit cold because (01:44) you know people are pouring off their hearts and they're preparing all their (01:47) dreams into it but uh you know nine times out of (01:54) uh out of a thousand probably um no the other way around anyway it's always if (01:59) you have to say no a lot um and so when you when you when you see a business (02:04) um what you're looking for is like why are you the exception right so it's not (02:07) good enough just to be like oh that sounds like a nice business I have to (02:11) think like wow this is that one business that one that I've been saying no for (02:15) months but today I'm going to say yes so just to just to kind of frame it for you (02:19) all right uh first up let's give a round of applause (02:31) let's see also just for context I don't know (02:38) anything so uh I'm not actually pretending that I didn't bother to learn (02:43) anything so this is I'm hearing about the business for the first time so okay (02:49) yeah launch in okay introduce yourself so (02:54) uh agricultural energy and mining companies uh higher ships and just to be (03:01) clear I'm not talking about containers I'm talking about full ships (03:07) Okay so you do something with ships I got that (03:11) part um (03:13) so this is like if I need to go rent is this like a rental like I need to go (03:17) rent so you are a commodity Trader you need to shift 50 000 tons of coal from (03:24) South Africa to Rotterdam and you come to us to find that ship I see so I took (03:29) a position on coal in South Africa and then (03:33) get it someplace else and what would I do today well I don't know anything (03:38) about this business so today you would pick up your phone and your email and (03:43) you would call five to ten Brokers and say hey I need to move this stuff (03:48) I see so this is like a marketplace where right now these Brokers and they (03:52) what do they take a big cut and then you're gonna like what's the value (03:55) proposition for me as as a Trader so think (04:00) I think you're speaking to all these different Brokers and it can take you (04:04) three to 24 hours to get some indications back it can take you (04:07) um up to two weeks and to actually book that ship uh with shipper Max we use (04:12) satellite technology and navigation and to cover every ship on Earth and we can (04:18) tell you which ship can make it in time and fit the specifications and is open (04:22) in seconds okay so is the idea that it's just (04:26) easier for me or do I get a better price like what's what closes the deal so this (04:32) there's two things when you think about trading one it's like a a very binary (04:36) thing as a commodity Trader and you need to know what your delivered price is and (04:42) to the customer otherwise someone else can come come and get that deal instead (04:46) of you and both myself and my co-founder have lost multi-million pound deals for (04:51) not getting Freight fast enough and and the second proposition is really (04:56) um service would you rather uh speak to five Brokers and receive thousands of (05:01) emails for a per deal or would you rather say this is my let's go (05:07) uh the letter sounds better I'm not in that position so so do you have a lot of (05:13) traction I mean are you what's your growth rate so we launched um about uh (05:17) our beta about seven weeks ago and since then what we were trying to do is talk (05:22) to these charterers these Traders and to see if they would talk to us and give us (05:26) requests and to date we've had about 4.5 million worth of gross and (05:32) um last week was um a great win for us because we signed one of the uh largest (05:38) energy trading companies in the world they shift 150 million and tons of (05:43) products annually and what does that deal represent for (05:46) you how much revenue are you going to make off of that so it's we're still (05:50) competing with other Brokers right now the revenue potential was 15 million (05:54) annually so we're now receiving those requests to compete on a deal by deal (05:58) basis to be faster and better so from their perspective you're just another (06:02) broker is that right yeah right they don't even know that you're like a tech (06:05) company they're just like oh new broker yeah is that good or bad for you (06:10) um so we're kind of edging are we in the way I've started this conversation (06:14) is saying like hey um our goal is to make this much much (06:19) faster like help us get there and so they're giving us a go they want smarter (06:24) intelligence and the smaller companies want better access to the market (06:29) um so today we're just saying yeah it's not all perfect out of the box right now (06:34) but um give us a go we're not worse than the (06:37) other Brokers have they used you yet or do they just say well think about you no (06:41) yeah they they they're giving us requests too so how many ships have you (06:45) shipped we haven't shipped in right now we've basically been getting those (06:49) requests which was our first test to see will they give them to us because that's (06:53) actually quite a big deal because they're telling you Market information (06:57) and does that mean that they're sending you the request but then they're going (07:00) with a different broker um right now basically what our problem (07:05) has been is that we (07:08) um need a bit more funding to get uh more men on the ground to help fulfill (07:13) these requests and because right now some of the larger brokers (07:18) have better intelligence and so we're starting kind of from zero and each time (07:25) um we're kind of getting closer and closer to actually booking that deal and (07:28) beating the brokers so you haven't actually won any deals yet no yeah how (07:33) soon will you win a deal I think next week all right well (07:36) talk next week so how much will that deal be worth then (07:42) assuming you do get this deal next week and that should be worth ten thousand (07:46) dollars and and what will be your costs behind (07:49) is that like pure profit for you uh that's like pure profit so it's our cost (07:54) is just like the men the people now why is this (07:59) why is this going to be like 100 billion dollar company (08:03) um so it's a huge market and so today (08:08) like the the amount that these Traders spend on brokerage fees today is about (08:14) three billion and dollars at least at current market low rates (08:20) and the largest company today is a company called Clarkson's who (08:26) um make 240 million GBP and per annum and I mean (08:32) to me that also means like you have some really formidable competitors like are (08:36) they really just gonna roll over and let you take their business (08:39) uh well no I don't think they're gonna roll over but um (08:42) so I think what's kind of what's interesting that's happening is that (08:47) the problem with these big guys like they are superior to the small Brokers (08:51) right they have more intelligence and they can serve bigger clients better (08:55) but who they can't serve is the little guys (08:59) um and they can't serve them because it's so manual with all their processes (09:04) so so basically you're thinking you're gonna come in at the bottom of the (09:08) market where they're just totally neglected yeah is that who you're going (09:11) after right now is that who this first customer is is that at the bottom of the (09:14) market um no we we 've been starting at the (09:17) bottom Market but actually a lot of the big just want to talk to us too because (09:21) of the superior intelligence that we can actually leverage free data but but I (09:26) mean if if there is this bottom of the market that's totally neglected why not (09:29) because you haven't done any ships yet right like why not just go find some of (09:33) these guys who are super neglected no we we're all working with those as well (09:39) so is this it seems like I see a lot of startups (09:43) where they're basically the high level pitch is there's these Brokers that make (09:47) a lot of money and we're going to cut them out with technology and take all (09:51) the money um but I mean just as a general form (09:54) like the most uh yeah obvious for me and familiar to most (09:58) of us is like the real estate market right like Redfin or someone was going (10:01) to come in and just blow away the Brokers but so far it seems like I don't (10:05) know if I've seen any of that those markets it seems like the Brokers are (10:08) very good at holding on to their position so the key key thing in this (10:13) market I mean I mean there's one thing to say that we still have Brokers and so (10:17) we're not a pure technology play We're enabling our Brokers to be much smarter (10:21) than anyone else and the cool thing about this Market is that (10:25) um intelligence is the main driver uh Traders reward their Brokers with deals (10:31) based on intelligence because you need that intelligence to keep getting good (10:35) rates so if\"}",

accident a couple of years ago one of our (00:20) speakers had to cancel at the last minute so we just threw together this (00:24) idea let's bring up some startups this is NYC we've never done it on stage (00:29) before but the idea was you know a lot of people they've gone through YC (00:34) it's coming up to demo day and actually they've never had a real experience like (00:39) pitching an investor just like cold someone who doesn't know anything about (00:43) them um so we got this idea hey let's just (00:46) try it out uh you know have a Founder come up give their pitch (00:51) and just to warn you they're usually like pretty rough that's kind of the (00:55) point of it and then we have a partner in this case it'll be Sam come repitch (01:00) the business and hopefully he does a smoother job (01:05) we'll see um (01:07) a few things to keep in mind this will be a little bit like the office hours (01:10) except not at all helpful and um probably uh maybe a little bit more uh (01:19) brutal so just to kind of give you some context like as a seed investor (01:25) um something you have to keep in mind is that the median startup is ultimately (01:29) worth about zero dollars um and probably 95 percent of startups (01:35) are a bad investment so you kind of get in a mode where (01:39) you're just a default no right and it's a very it's a little bit cold because (01:44) you know people are pouring off their hearts and they're preparing all their (01:47) dreams into it but uh you know nine times out of (01:54) uh out of a thousand probably um no the other way around anyway it's always if (01:59) you have to say no a lot um and so when you when you when you see a business (02:04) um what you're looking for is like why are you the exception right so it's not (02:07) good enough just to be like oh that sounds like a nice business I have to (02:11) think like wow this is that one business that one that I've been saying no for (02:15) months but today I'm going to say yes so just to just to kind of frame it for you (02:19) all right uh first up let's give a round of applause (02:31) let's see also just for context I don't know (02:38) anything so uh I'm not actually pretending that I didn't bother to learn (02:43) anything so this is I'm hearing about the business for the first time so okay (02:49) yeah launch in okay introduce yourself so (02:54) uh agricultural energy and mining companies uh higher ships and just to be (03:01) clear I'm not talking about containers I'm talking about full ships (03:07) Okay so you do something with ships I got that (03:11) part um (03:13) so this is like if I need to go rent is this like a rental like I need to go (03:17) rent so you are a commodity Trader you need to shift 50 000 tons of coal from (03:24) South Africa to Rotterdam and you come to us to find that ship I see so I took (03:29) a position on coal in South Africa and then (03:33) get it someplace else and what would I do today well I don't know anything (03:38) about this business so today you would pick up your phone and your email and (03:43) you would call five to ten Brokers and say hey I need to move this stuff (03:48) I see so this is like a marketplace where right now these Brokers and they (03:52) what do they take a big cut and then you're gonna like what's the value (03:55) proposition for me as as a Trader so think (04:00) I think you're speaking to all these different Brokers and it can take you (04:04) three to 24 hours to get some indications back it can take you (04:07) um up to two weeks and to actually book that ship uh with shipper Max we use (04:12) satellite technology and navigation and to cover every ship on Earth and we can (04:18) tell you which ship can make it in time and fit the specifications and is open (04:22) in seconds okay so is the idea that it's just (04:26) easier for me or do I get a better price like what's what closes the deal so this (04:32) there's two things when you think about trading one it's like a a very binary (04:36) thing as a commodity Trader and you need to know what your delivered price is and (04:42) to the customer otherwise someone else can come come and get that deal instead (04:46) of you and both myself and my co-founder have lost multi-million pound deals for (04:51) not getting Freight fast enough and and the second proposition is really (04:56) um service would you rather uh speak to five Brokers and receive thousands of (05:01) emails for a per deal or would you rather say this is my let's go (05:07) uh the letter sounds better I'm not in that position so so do you have a lot of (05:13) traction I mean are you what's your growth rate so we launched um about uh (05:17) our beta about seven weeks ago and since then what we were trying to do is talk (05:22) to these charterers these Traders and to see if they would talk to us and give us (05:26) requests and to date we've had about 4.5 million worth of gross and (05:32) um last week was um a great win for us because we signed one of the uh largest (05:38) energy trading companies in the world they shift 150 million and tons of (05:43) products annually and what does that deal represent for (05:46) you how much revenue are you going to make off of that so it's we're still (05:50) competing with other Brokers right now the revenue potential was 15 million (05:54) annually so we're now receiving those requests to compete on a deal by deal (05:58) basis to be faster and better so from their perspective you're just another (06:02) broker is that right yeah right they don't even know that you're like a tech (06:05) company they're just like oh new broker yeah is that good or bad for you (06:10) um so we're kind of edging are we in the way I've started this conversation (06:14) is saying like hey um our goal is to make this much much (06:19) faster like help us get there and so they're giving us a go they want smarter (06:24) intelligence and the smaller companies want better access to the market (06:29) um so today we're just saying yeah it's not all perfect out of the box right now (06:34) but um give us a go we're not worse than the (06:37) other Brokers have they used you yet or do they just say well think about you no (06:41) yeah they they they're giving us requests too so how many ships have you (06:45) shipped we haven't shipped in right now we've basically been getting those (06:49) requests which was our first test to see will they give them to us because that's (06:53) actually quite a big deal because they're telling you Market information (06:57) and does that mean that they're sending you the request but then they're going (07:00) with a different broker um right now basically what our problem (07:05) has been is that we (07:08) um need a bit more funding to get uh more men on the ground to help fulfill (07:13) these requests and because right now some of the larger brokers (07:18) have better intelligence and so we're starting kind of from zero and each time (07:25) um we're kind of getting closer and closer to actually booking that deal and (07:28) beating the brokers so you haven't actually won any deals yet no yeah how (07:33) soon will you win a deal I think next week all right well (07:36) talk next week so how much will that deal be worth then (07:42) assuming you do get this deal next week and that should be worth ten thousand (07:46) dollars and and what will be your costs behind (07:49) is that like pure profit for you uh that's like pure profit so it's our cost (07:54) is just like the men the people now why is this (07:59) why is this going to be like 100 billion dollar company (08:03) um so it's a huge market and so today (08:08) like the the amount that these Traders spend on brokerage fees today is about (08:14) three billion and dollars at least at current market low rates (08:20) and the largest company today is a company called Clarkson's who (08:26) um make 240 million GBP and per annum and I mean (08:32) to me that also means like you have some really formidable competitors like are (08:36) they really just gonna roll over and let you take their business (08:39) uh well no I don't think they're gonna roll over but um (08:42) so I think what's kind of what's interesting that's happening is that (08:47) the problem with these big guys like they are superior to the small Brokers (08:51) right they have more intelligence and they can serve bigger clients better (08:55) but who they can't serve is the little guys (08:59) um and they can't serve them because it's so manual with all their processes (09:04) so so basically you're thinking you're gonna come in at the bottom of the (09:08) market where they're just totally neglected yeah is that who you're going (09:11) after right now is that who this first customer is is that at the bottom of the (09:14) market um no we we 've been starting at the (09:17) bottom Market but actually a lot of the big just want to talk to us too because (09:21) of the superior intelligence that we can actually leverage free data but but I (09:26) mean if if there is this bottom of the market that's totally neglected why not (09:29) because you haven't done any ships yet right like why not just go find some of (09:33) these guys who are super neglected no we we're all working with those as well (09:39) so is this it seems like I see a lot of startups (09:43) where they're basically the high level pitch is there's these Brokers that make (09:47) a lot of money and we're going to cut them out with technology and take all (09:51) the money um but I mean just as a general form (09:54) like the most uh yeah obvious for me and familiar to most (09:58) of us is like the real estate market right like Redfin or someone was going (10:01) to come in and just blow away the Brokers but so far it seems like I don't (10:05) know if I've seen any of that those markets it seems like the Brokers are (10:08) very good at holding on to their position so the key key thing in this (10:13) market I mean I mean there's one thing to say that we still have Brokers and so (10:17) we're not a pure technology play We're enabling our Brokers to be much smarter (10:21) than anyone else and the cool thing about this Market is that (10:25) um intelligence is the main driver uh Traders reward their Brokers with deals (10:31) based on intelligence because you need that intelligence to keep getting good (10:35) rates so if\"}",

accident a couple of years ago one of our (00:20) speakers had to cancel at the last minute so we just threw together this (00:24) idea let's bring up some startups this is NYC we've never done it on stage (00:29) before but the idea was you know a lot of people they've gone through YC (00:34) it's coming up to demo day and actually they've never had a real experience like (00:39) pitching an investor just like cold someone who doesn't know anything about (00:43) them um so we got this idea hey let's just (00:46) try it out uh you know have a Founder come up give their pitch (00:51) and just to warn you they're usually like pretty rough that's kind of the (00:55) point of it and then we have a partner in this case it'll be Sam come repitch (01:00) the business and hopefully he does a smoother job (01:05) we'll see um (01:07) a few things to keep in mind this will be a little bit like the office hours (01:10) except not at all helpful and um probably uh maybe a little bit more uh (01:19) brutal so just to kind of give you some context like as a seed investor (01:25) um something you have to keep in mind is that the median startup is ultimately (01:29) worth about zero dollars um and probably 95 percent of startups (01:35) are a bad investment so you kind of get in a mode where (01:39) you're just a default no right and it's a very it's a little bit cold because (01:44) you know people are pouring off their hearts and they're preparing all their (01:47) dreams into it but uh you know nine times out of (01:54) uh out of a thousand probably um no the other way around anyway it's always if (01:59) you have to say no a lot um and so when you when you when you see a business (02:04) um what you're looking for is like why are you the exception right so it's not (02:07) good enough just to be like oh that sounds like a nice business I have to (02:11) think like wow this is that one business that one that I've been saying no for (02:15) months but today I'm going to say yes so just to just to kind of frame it for you (02:19) all right uh first up let's give a round of applause (02:31) let's see also just for context I don't know (02:38) anything so uh I'm not actually pretending that I didn't bother to learn (02:43) anything so this is I'm hearing about the business for the first time so okay (02:49) yeah launch in okay introduce yourself so (02:54) uh agricultural energy and mining companies uh higher ships and just to be (03:01) clear I'm not talking about containers I'm talking about full ships (03:07) Okay so you do something with ships I got that (03:11) part um (03:13) so this is like if I need to go rent is this like a rental like I need to go (03:17) rent so you are a commodity Trader you need to shift 50 000 tons of coal from (03:24) South Africa to Rotterdam and you come to us to find that ship I see so I took (03:29) a position on coal in South Africa and then (03:33) get it someplace else and what would I do today well I don't know anything (03:38) about this business so today you would pick up your phone and your email and (03:43) you would call five to ten Brokers and say hey I need to move this stuff (03:48) I see so this is like a marketplace where right now these Brokers and they (03:52) what do they take a big cut and then you're gonna like what's the value (03:55) proposition for me as as a Trader so think (04:00) I think you're speaking to all these different Brokers and it can take you (04:04) three to 24 hours to get some indications back it can take you (04:07) um up to two weeks and to actually book that ship uh with shipper Max we use (04:12) satellite technology and navigation and to cover every ship on Earth and we can (04:18) tell you which ship can make it in time and fit the specifications and is open (04:22) in seconds okay so is the idea that it's just (04:26) easier for me or do I get a better price like what's what closes the deal so this (04:32) there's two things when you think about trading one it's like a a very binary (04:36) thing as a commodity Trader and you need to know what your delivered price is and (04:42) to the customer otherwise someone else can come come and get that deal instead (04:46) of you and both myself and my co-founder have lost multi-million pound deals for (04:51) not getting Freight fast enough and and the second proposition is really (04:56) um service would you rather uh speak to five Brokers and receive thousands of (05:01) emails for a per deal or would you rather say this is my let's go (05:07) uh the letter sounds better I'm not in that position so so do you have a lot of (05:13) traction I mean are you what's your growth rate so we launched um about uh (05:17) our beta about seven weeks ago and since then what we were trying to do is talk (05:22) to these charterers these Traders and to see if they would talk to us and give us (05:26) requests and to date we've had about 4.5 million worth of gross and (05:32) um last week was um a great win for us because we signed one of the uh largest (05:38) energy trading companies in the world they shift 150 million and tons of (05:43) products annually and what does that deal represent for (05:46) you how much revenue are you going to make off of that so it's we're still (05:50) competing with other Brokers right now the revenue potential was 15 million (05:54) annually so we're now receiving those requests to compete on a deal by deal (05:58) basis to be faster and better so from their perspective you're just another (06:02) broker is that right yeah right they don't even know that you're like a tech (06:05) company they're just like oh new broker yeah is that good or bad for you (06:10) um so we're kind of edging are we in the way I've started this conversation (06:14) is saying like hey um our goal is to make this much much (06:19) faster like help us get there and so they're giving us a go they want smarter (06:24) intelligence and the smaller companies want better access to the market (06:29) um so today we're just saying yeah it's not all perfect out of the box right now (06:34) but um give us a go we're not worse than the (06:37) other Brokers have they used you yet or do they just say well think about you no (06:41) yeah they they they're giving us requests too so how many ships have you (06:45) shipped we haven't shipped in right now we've basically been getting those (06:49) requests which was our first test to see will they give them to us because that's (06:53) actually quite a big deal because they're telling you Market information (06:57) and does that mean that they're sending you the request but then they're going (07:00) with a different broker um right now basically what our problem (07:05) has been is that we (07:08) um need a bit more funding to get uh more men on the ground to help fulfill (07:13) these requests and because right now some of the larger brokers (07:18) have better intelligence and so we're starting kind of from zero and each time (07:25) um we're kind of getting closer and closer to actually booking that deal and (07:28) beating the brokers so you haven't actually won any deals yet no yeah how (07:33) soon will you win a deal I think next week all right well (07:36) talk next week so how much will that deal be worth then (07:42) assuming you do get this deal next week and that should be worth ten thousand (07:46) dollars and and what will be your costs behind (07:49) is that like pure profit for you uh that's like pure profit so it's our cost (07:54) is just like the men the people now why is this (07:59) why is this going to be like 100 billion dollar company (08:03) um so it's a huge market and so today (08:08) like the the amount that these Traders spend on brokerage fees today is about (08:14) three billion and dollars at least at current market low rates (08:20) and the largest company today is a company called Clarkson's who (08:26) um make 240 million GBP and per annum and I mean (08:32) to me that also means like you have some really formidable competitors like are (08:36) they really just gonna roll over and let you take their business (08:39) uh well no I don't think they're gonna roll over but um (08:42) so I think what's kind of what's interesting that's happening is that (08:47) the problem with these big guys like they are superior to the small Brokers (08:51) right they have more intelligence and they can serve bigger clients better (08:55) but who they can't serve is the little guys (08:59) um and they can't serve them because it's so manual with all their processes (09:04) so so basically you're thinking you're gonna come in at the bottom of the (09:08) market where they're just totally neglected yeah is that who you're going (09:11) after right now is that who this first customer is is that at the bottom of the (09:14) market um no we we 've been starting at the (09:17) bottom Market but actually a lot of the big just want to talk to us too because (09:21) of the superior intelligence that we can actually leverage free data but but I (09:26) mean if if there is this bottom of the market that's totally neglected why not (09:29) because you haven't done any ships yet right like why not just go find some of (09:33) these guys who are super neglected no we we're all working with those as well (09:39) so is this it seems like I see a lot of startups (09:43) where they're basically the high level pitch is there's these Brokers that make (09:47) a lot of money and we're going to cut them out with technology and take all (09:51) the money um but I mean just as a general form (09:54) like the most uh yeah obvious for me and familiar to most (09:58) of us is like the real estate market right like Redfin or someone was going (10:01) to come in and just blow away the Brokers but so far it seems like I don't (10:05) know if I've seen any of that those markets it seems like the Brokers are (10:08) very good at holding on to their position so the key key thing in this (10:13) market I mean I mean there's one thing to say that we still have Brokers and so (10:17) we're not a pure technology play We're enabling our Brokers to be much smarter (10:21) than anyone else and the cool thing about this Market is that (10:25) um intelligence is the main driver uh Traders reward their Brokers with deals (10:31) based on intelligence because you need that intelligence to keep getting good (10:35) rates so if\"}",

accident a couple of years ago one of our (00:20) speakers had to cancel at the last minute so we just threw together this (00:24) idea let's bring up some startups this is NYC we've never done it on stage (00:29) before but the idea was you know a lot of people they've gone through YC (00:34) it's coming up to demo day and actually they've never had a real experience like (00:39) pitching an investor just like cold someone who doesn't know anything about (00:43) them um so we got this idea hey let's just (00:46) try it out uh you know have a Founder come up give their pitch (00:51) and just to warn you they're usually like pretty rough that's kind of the (00:55) point of it and then we have a partner in this case it'll be Sam come repitch (01:00) the business and hopefully he does a smoother job (01:05) we'll see um (01:07) a few things to keep in mind this will be a little bit like the office hours (01:10) except not at all helpful and um probably uh maybe a little bit more uh (01:19) brutal so just to kind of give you some context like as a seed investor (01:25) um something you have to keep in mind is that the median startup is ultimately (01:29) worth about zero dollars um and probably 95 percent of startups (01:35) are a bad investment so you kind of get in a mode where (01:39) you're just a default no right and it's a very it's a little bit cold because (01:44) you know people are pouring off their hearts and they're preparing all their (01:47) dreams into it but uh you know nine times out of (01:54) uh out of a thousand probably um no the other way around anyway it's always if (01:59) you have to say no a lot um and so when you when you when you see a business (02:04) um what you're looking for is like why are you the exception right so it's not (02:07) good enough just to be like oh that sounds like a nice business I have to (02:11) think like wow this is that one business that one that I've been saying no for (02:15) months but today I'm going to say yes so just to just to kind of frame it for you (02:19) all right uh first up let's give a round of applause (02:31) let's see also just for context I don't know (02:38) anything so uh I'm not actually pretending that I didn't bother to learn (02:43) anything so this is I'm hearing about the business for the first time so okay (02:49) yeah launch in okay introduce yourself so (02:54) uh agricultural energy and mining companies uh higher ships and just to be (03:01) clear I'm not talking about containers I'm talking about full ships (03:07) Okay so you do something with ships I got that (03:11) part um (03:13) so this is like if I need to go rent is this like a rental like I need to go (03:17) rent so you are a commodity Trader you need to shift 50 000 tons of coal from (03:24) South Africa to Rotterdam and you come to us to find that ship I see so I took (03:29) a position on coal in South Africa and then (03:33) get it someplace else and what would I do today well I don't know anything (03:38) about this business so today you would pick up your phone and your email and (03:43) you would call five to ten Brokers and say hey I need to move this stuff (03:48) I see so this is like a marketplace where right now these Brokers and they (03:52) what do they take a big cut and then you're gonna like what's the value (03:55) proposition for me as as a Trader so think (04:00) I think you're speaking to all these different Brokers and it can take you (04:04) three to 24 hours to get some indications back it can take you (04:07) um up to two weeks and to actually book that ship uh with shipper Max we use (04:12) satellite technology and navigation and to cover every ship on Earth and we can (04:18) tell you which ship can make it in time and fit the specifications and is open (04:22) in seconds okay so is the idea that it's just (04:26) easier for me or do I get a better price like what's what closes the deal so this (04:32) there's two things when you think about trading one it's like a a very binary (04:36) thing as a commodity Trader and you need to know what your delivered price is and (04:42) to the customer otherwise someone else can come come and get that deal instead (04:46) of you and both myself and my co-founder have lost multi-million pound deals for (04:51) not getting Freight fast enough and and the second proposition is really (04:56) um service would you rather uh speak to five Brokers and receive thousands of (05:01) emails for a per deal or would you rather say this is my let's go (05:07) uh the letter sounds better I'm not in that position so so do you have a lot of (05:13) traction I mean are you what's your growth rate so we launched um about uh (05:17) our beta about seven weeks ago and since then what we were trying to do is talk (05:22) to these charterers these Traders and to see if they would talk to us and give us (05:26) requests and to date we've had about 4.5 million worth of gross and (05:32) um last week was um a great win for us because we signed one of the uh largest (05:38) energy trading companies in the world they shift 150 million and tons of (05:43) products annually and what does that deal represent for (05:46) you how much revenue are you going to make off of that so it's we're still (05:50) competing with other Brokers right now the revenue potential was 15 million (05:54) annually so we're now receiving those requests to compete on a deal by deal (05:58) basis to be faster and better so from their perspective you're just another (06:02) broker is that right yeah right they don't even know that you're like a tech (06:05) company they're just like oh new broker yeah is that good or bad for you (06:10) um so we're kind of edging are we in the way I've started this conversation (06:14) is saying like hey um our goal is to make this much much (06:19) faster like help us get there and so they're giving us a go they want smarter (06:24) intelligence and the smaller companies want better access to the market (06:29) um so today we're just saying yeah it's not all perfect out of the box right now (06:34) but um give us a go we're not worse than the (06:37) other Brokers have they used you yet or do they just say well think about you no (06:41) yeah they they they're giving us requests too so how many ships have you (06:45) shipped we haven't shipped in right now we've basically been getting those (06:49) requests which was our first test to see will they give them to us because that's (06:53) actually quite a big deal because they're telling you Market information (06:57) and does that mean that they're sending you the request but then they're going (07:00) with a different broker um right now basically what our problem (07:05) has been is that we (07:08) um need a bit more funding to get uh more men on the ground to help fulfill (07:13) these requests and because right now some of the larger brokers (07:18) have better intelligence and so we're starting kind of from zero and each time (07:25) um we're kind of getting closer and closer to actually booking that deal and (07:28) beating the brokers so you haven't actually won any deals yet no yeah how (07:33) soon will you win a deal I think next week all right well (07:36) talk next week so how much will that deal be worth then (07:42) assuming you do get this deal next week and that should be worth ten thousand (07:46) dollars and and what will be your costs behind (07:49) is that like pure profit for you uh that's like pure profit so it's our cost (07:54) is just like the men the people now why is this (07:59) why is this going to be like 100 billion dollar company (08:03) um so it's a huge market and so today (08:08) like the the amount that these Traders spend on brokerage fees today is about (08:14) three billion and dollars at least at current market low rates (08:20) and the largest company today is a company called Clarkson's who (08:26) um make 240 million GBP and per annum and I mean (08:32) to me that also means like you have some really formidable competitors like are (08:36) they really just gonna roll over and let you take their business (08:39) uh well no I don't think they're gonna roll over but um (08:42) so I think what's kind of what's interesting that's happening is that (08:47) the problem with these big guys like they are superior to the small Brokers (08:51) right they have more intelligence and they can serve bigger clients better (08:55) but who they can't serve is the little guys (08:59) um and they can't serve them because it's so manual with all their processes (09:04) so so basically you're thinking you're gonna come in at the bottom of the (09:08) market where they're just totally neglected yeah is that who you're going (09:11) after right now is that who this first customer is is that at the bottom of the (09:14) market um no we we 've been starting at the (09:17) bottom Market but actually a lot of the big just want to talk to us too because (09:21) of the superior intelligence that we can actually leverage free data but but I (09:26) mean if if there is this bottom of the market that's totally neglected why not (09:29) because you haven't done any ships yet right like why not just go find some of (09:33) these guys who are super neglected no we we're all working with those as well (09:39) so is this it seems like I see a lot of startups (09:43) where they're basically the high level pitch is there's these Brokers that make (09:47) a lot of money and we're going to cut them out with technology and take all (09:51) the money um but I mean just as a general form (09:54) like the most uh yeah obvious for me and familiar to most (09:58) of us is like the real estate market right like Redfin or someone was going (10:01) to come in and just blow away the Brokers but so far it seems like I don't (10:05) know if I've seen any of that those markets it seems like the Brokers are (10:08) very good at holding on to their position so the key key thing in this (10:13) market I mean I mean there's one thing to say that we still have Brokers and so (10:17) we're not a pure technology play We're enabling our Brokers to be much smarter (10:21) than anyone else and the cool thing about this Market is that (10:25) um intelligence is the main driver uh Traders reward their Brokers with deals (10:31) based on intelligence because you need that intelligence to keep getting good (10:35) rates so if\"}",

accident a couple of years ago one of our (00:20) speakers had to cancel at the last minute so we just threw together this (00:24) idea let's bring up some startups this is NYC we've never done it on stage (00:29) before but the idea was you know a lot of people they've gone through YC (00:34) it's coming up to demo day and actually they've never had a real experience like (00:39) pitching an investor just like cold someone who doesn't know anything about (00:43) them um so we got this idea hey let's just (00:46) try it out uh you know have a Founder come up give their pitch (00:51) and just to warn you they're usually like pretty rough that's kind of the (00:55) point of it and then we have a partner in this case it'll be Sam come repitch (01:00) the business and hopefully he does a smoother job (01:05) we'll see um (01:07) a few things to keep in mind this will be a little bit like the office hours (01:10) except not at all helpful and um probably uh maybe a little bit more uh (01:19) brutal so just to kind of give you some context like as a seed investor (01:25) um something you have to keep in mind is that the median startup is ultimately (01:29) worth about zero dollars um and probably 95 percent of startups (01:35) are a bad investment so you kind of get in a mode where (01:39) you're just a default no right and it's a very it's a little bit cold because (01:44) you know people are pouring off their hearts and they're preparing all their (01:47) dreams into it but uh you know nine times out of (01:54) uh out of a thousand probably um no the other way around anyway it's always if (01:59) you have to say no a lot um and so when you when you when you see a business (02:04) um what you're looking for is like why are you the exception right so it's not (02:07) good enough just to be like oh that sounds like a nice business I have to (02:11) think like wow this is that one business that one that I've been saying no for (02:15) months but today I'm going to say yes so just to just to kind of frame it for you (02:19) all right uh first up let's give a round of applause (02:31) let's see also just for context I don't know (02:38) anything so uh I'm not actually pretending that I didn't bother to learn (02:43) anything so this is I'm hearing about the business for the first time so okay (02:49) yeah launch in okay introduce yourself so (02:54) uh agricultural energy and mining companies uh higher ships and just to be (03:01) clear I'm not talking about containers I'm talking about full ships (03:07) Okay so you do something with ships I got that (03:11) part um (03:13) so this is like if I need to go rent is this like a rental like I need to go (03:17) rent so you are a commodity Trader you need to shift 50 000 tons of coal from (03:24) South Africa to Rotterdam and you come to us to find that ship I see so I took (03:29) a position on coal in South Africa and then (03:33) get it someplace else and what would I do today well I don't know anything (03:38) about this business so today you would pick up your phone and your email and (03:43) you would call five to ten Brokers and say hey I need to move this stuff (03:48) I see so this is like a marketplace where right now these Brokers and they (03:52) what do they take a big cut and then you're gonna like what's the value (03:55) proposition for me as as a Trader so think (04:00) I think you're speaking to all these different Brokers and it can take you (04:04) three to 24 hours to get some indications back it can take you (04:07) um up to two weeks and to actually book that ship uh with shipper Max we use (04:12) satellite technology and navigation and to cover every ship on Earth and we can (04:18) tell you which ship can make it in time and fit the specifications and is open (04:22) in seconds okay so is the idea that it's just (04:26) easier for me or do I get a better price like what's what closes the deal so this (04:32) there's two things when you think about trading one it's like a a very binary (04:36) thing as a commodity Trader and you need to know what your delivered price is and (04:42) to the customer otherwise someone else can come come and get that deal instead (04:46) of you and both myself and my co-founder have lost multi-million pound deals for (04:51) not getting Freight fast enough and and the second proposition is really (04:56) um service would you rather uh speak to five Brokers and receive thousands of (05:01) emails for a per deal or would you rather say this is my let's go (05:07) uh the letter sounds better I'm not in that position so so do you have a lot of (05:13) traction I mean are you what's your growth rate so we launched um about uh (05:17) our beta about seven weeks ago and since then what we were trying to do is talk (05:22) to these charterers these Traders and to see if they would talk to us and give us (05:26) requests and to date we've had about 4.5 million worth of gross and (05:32) um last week was um a great win for us because we signed one of the uh largest (05:38) energy trading companies in the world they shift 150 million and tons of (05:43) products annually and what does that deal represent for (05:46) you how much revenue are you going to make off of that so it's we're still (05:50) competing with other Brokers right now the revenue potential was 15 million (05:54) annually so we're now receiving those requests to compete on a deal by deal (05:58) basis to be faster and better so from their perspective you're just another (06:02) broker is that right yeah right they don't even know that you're like a tech (06:05) company they're just like oh new broker yeah is that good or bad for you (06:10) um so we're kind of edging are we in the way I've started this conversation (06:14) is saying like hey um our goal is to make this much much (06:19) faster like help us get there and so they're giving us a go they want smarter (06:24) intelligence and the smaller companies want better access to the market (06:29) um so today we're just saying yeah it's not all perfect out of the box right now (06:34) but um give us a go we're not worse than the (06:37) other Brokers have they used you yet or do they just say well think about you no (06:41) yeah they they they're giving us requests too so how many ships have you (06:45) shipped we haven't shipped in right now we've basically been getting those (06:49) requests which was our first test to see will they give them to us because that's (06:53) actually quite a big deal because they're telling you Market information (06:57) and does that mean that they're sending you the request but then they're going (07:00) with a different broker um right now basically what our problem (07:05) has been is that we (07:08) um need a bit more funding to get uh more men on the ground to help fulfill (07:13) these requests and because right now some of the larger brokers (07:18) have better intelligence and so we're starting kind of from zero and each time (07:25) um we're kind of getting closer and closer to actually booking that deal and (07:28) beating the brokers so you haven't actually won any deals yet no yeah how (07:33) soon will you win a deal I think next week all right well (07:36) talk next week so how much will that deal be worth then (07:42) assuming you do get this deal next week and that should be worth ten thousand (07:46) dollars and and what will be your costs behind (07:49) is that like pure profit for you uh that's like pure profit so it's our cost (07:54) is just like the men the people now why is this (07:59) why is this going to be like 100 billion dollar company (08:03) um so it's a huge market and so today (08:08) like the the amount that these Traders spend on brokerage fees today is about (08:14) three billion and dollars at least at current market low rates (08:20) and the largest company today is a company called Clarkson's who (08:26) um make 240 million GBP and per annum and I mean (08:32) to me that also means like you have some really formidable competitors like are (08:36) they really just gonna roll over and let you take their business (08:39) uh well no I don't think they're gonna roll over but um (08:42) so I think what's kind of what's interesting that's happening is that (08:47) the problem with these big guys like they are superior to the small Brokers (08:51) right they have more intelligence and they can serve bigger clients better (08:55) but who they can't serve is the little guys (08:59) um and they can't serve them because it's so manual with all their processes (09:04) so so basically you're thinking you're gonna come in at the bottom of the (09:08) market where they're just totally neglected yeah is that who you're going (09:11) after right now is that who this first customer is is that at the bottom of the (09:14) market um no we we 've been starting at the (09:17) bottom Market but actually a lot of the big just want to talk to us too because (09:21) of the superior intelligence that we can actually leverage free data but but I (09:26) mean if if there is this bottom of the market that's totally neglected why not (09:29) because you haven't done any ships yet right like why not just go find some of (09:33) these guys who are super neglected no we we're all working with those as well (09:39) so is this it seems like I see a lot of startups (09:43) where they're basically the high level pitch is there's these Brokers that make (09:47) a lot of money and we're going to cut them out with technology and take all (09:51) the money um but I mean just as a general form (09:54) like the most uh yeah obvious for me and familiar to most (09:58) of us is like the real estate market right like Redfin or someone was going (10:01) to come in and just blow away the Brokers but so far it seems like I don't (10:05) know if I've seen any of that those markets it seems like the Brokers are (10:08) very good at holding on to their position so the key key thing in this (10:13) market I mean I mean there's one thing to say that we still have Brokers and so (10:17) we're not a pure technology play We're enabling our Brokers to be much smarter (10:21) than anyone else and the cool thing about this Market is that (10:25) um intelligence is the main driver uh Traders reward their Brokers with deals (10:31) based on intelligence because you need that intelligence to keep getting good (10:35) rates so if\"}",

accident a couple of years ago one of our (00:20) speakers had to cancel at the last minute so we just threw together this (00:24) idea let's bring up some startups this is NYC we've never done it on stage (00:29) before but the idea was you know a lot of people they've gone through YC (00:34) it's coming up to demo day and actually they've never had a real experience like (00:39) pitching an investor just like cold someone who doesn't know anything about (00:43) them um so we got this idea hey let's just (00:46) try it out uh you know have a Founder come up give their pitch (00:51) and just to warn you they're usually like pretty rough that's kind of the (00:55) point of it and then we have a partner in this case it'll be Sam come repitch (01:00) the business and hopefully he does a smoother job (01:05) we'll see um (01:07) a few things to keep in mind this will be a little bit like the office hours (01:10) except not at all helpful and um probably uh maybe a little bit more uh (01:19) brutal so just to kind of give you some context like as a seed investor (01:25) um something you have to keep in mind is that the median startup is ultimately (01:29) worth about zero dollars um and probably 95 percent of startups (01:35) are a bad investment so you kind of get in a mode where (01:39) you're just a default no right and it's a very it's a little bit cold because (01:44) you know people are pouring off their hearts and they're preparing all their (01:47) dreams into it but uh you know nine times out of (01:54) uh out of a thousand probably um no the other way around anyway it's always if (01:59) you have to say no a lot um and so when you when you when you see a business (02:04) um what you're looking for is like why are you the exception right so it's not (02:07) good enough just to be like oh that sounds like a nice business I have to (02:11) think like wow this is that one business that one that I've been saying no for (02:15) months but today I'm going to say yes so just to just to kind of frame it for you (02:19) all right uh first up let's give a round of applause (02:31) let's see also just for context I don't know (02:38) anything so uh I'm not actually pretending that I didn't bother to learn (02:43) anything so this is I'm hearing about the business for the first time so okay (02:49) yeah launch in okay introduce yourself so (02:54) uh agricultural energy and mining companies uh higher ships and just to be (03:01) clear I'm not talking about containers I'm talking about full ships (03:07) Okay so you do something with ships I got that (03:11) part um (03:13) so this is like if I need to go rent is this like a rental like I need to go (03:17) rent so you are a commodity Trader you need to shift 50 000 tons of coal from (03:24) South Africa to Rotterdam and you come to us to find that ship I see so I took (03:29) a position on coal in South Africa and then (03:33) get it someplace else and what would I do today well I don't know anything (03:38) about this business so today you would pick up your phone and your email and (03:43) you would call five to ten Brokers and say hey I need to move this stuff (03:48) I see so this is like a marketplace where right now these Brokers and they (03:52) what do they take a big cut and then you're gonna like what's the value (03:55) proposition for me as as a Trader so think (04:00) I think you're speaking to all these different Brokers and it can take you (04:04) three to 24 hours to get some indications back it can take you (04:07) um up to two weeks and to actually book that ship uh with shipper Max we use (04:12) satellite technology and navigation and to cover every ship on Earth and we can (04:18) tell you which ship can make it in time and fit the specifications and is open (04:22) in seconds okay so is the idea that it's just (04:26) easier for me or do I get a better price like what's what closes the deal so this (04:32) there's two things when you think about trading one it's like a a very binary (04:36) thing as a commodity Trader and you need to know what your delivered price is and (04:42) to the customer otherwise someone else can come come and get that deal instead (04:46) of you and both myself and my co-founder have lost multi-million pound deals for (04:51) not getting Freight fast enough and and the second proposition is really (04:56) um service would you rather uh speak to five Brokers and receive thousands of (05:01) emails for a per deal or would you rather say this is my let's go (05:07) uh the letter sounds better I'm not in that position so so do you have a lot of (05:13) traction I mean are you what's your growth rate so we launched um about uh (05:17) our beta about seven weeks ago and since then what we were trying to do is talk (05:22) to these charterers these Traders and to see if they would talk to us and give us (05:26) requests and to date we've had about 4.5 million worth of gross and (05:32) um last week was um a great win for us because we signed one of the uh largest (05:38) energy trading companies in the world they shift 150 million and tons of (05:43) products annually and what does that deal represent for (05:46) you how much revenue are you going to make off of that so it's we're still (05:50) competing with other Brokers right now the revenue potential was 15 million (05:54) annually so we're now receiving those requests to compete on a deal by deal (05:58) basis to be faster and better so from their perspective you're just another (06:02) broker is that right yeah right they don't even know that you're like a tech (06:05) company they're just like oh new broker yeah is that good or bad for you (06:10) um so we're kind of edging are we in the way I've started this conversation (06:14) is saying like hey um our goal is to make this much much (06:19) faster like help us get there and so they're giving us a go they want smarter (06:24) intelligence and the smaller companies want better access to the market (06:29) um so today we're just saying yeah it's not all perfect out of the box right now (06:34) but um give us a go we're not worse than the (06:37) other Brokers have they used you yet or do they just say well think about you no (06:41) yeah they they they're giving us requests too so how many ships have you (06:45) shipped we haven't shipped in right now we've basically been getting those (06:49) requests which was our first test to see will they give them to us because that's (06:53) actually quite a big deal because they're telling you Market information (06:57) and does that mean that they're sending you the request but then they're going (07:00) with a different broker um right now basically what our problem (07:05) has been is that we (07:08) um need a bit more funding to get uh more men on the ground to help fulfill (07:13) these requests and because right now some of the larger brokers (07:18) have better intelligence and so we're starting kind of from zero and each time (07:25) um we're kind of getting closer and closer to actually booking that deal and (07:28) beating the brokers so you haven't actually won any deals yet no yeah how (07:33) soon will you win a deal I think next week all right well (07:36) talk next week so how much will that deal be worth then (07:42) assuming you do get this deal next week and that should be worth ten thousand (07:46) dollars and and what will be your costs behind (07:49) is that like pure profit for you uh that's like pure profit so it's our cost (07:54) is just like the men the people now why is this (07:59) why is this going to be like 100 billion dollar company (08:03) um so it's a huge market and so today (08:08) like the the amount that these Traders spend on brokerage fees today is about (08:14) three billion and dollars at least at current market low rates (08:20) and the largest company today is a company called Clarkson's who (08:26) um make 240 million GBP and per annum and I mean (08:32) to me that also means like you have some really formidable competitors like are (08:36) they really just gonna roll over and let you take their business (08:39) uh well no I don't think they're gonna roll over but um (08:42) so I think what's kind of what's interesting that's happening is that (08:47) the problem with these big guys like they are superior to the small Brokers (08:51) right they have more intelligence and they can serve bigger clients better (08:55) but who they can't serve is the little guys (08:59) um and they can't serve them because it's so manual with all their processes (09:04) so so basically you're thinking you're gonna come in at the bottom of the (09:08) market where they're just totally neglected yeah is that who you're going (09:11) after right now is that who this first customer is is that at the bottom of the (09:14) market um no we we 've been starting at the (09:17) bottom Market but actually a lot of the big just want to talk to us too because (09:21) of the superior intelligence that we can actually leverage free data but but I (09:26) mean if if there is this bottom of the market that's totally neglected why not (09:29) because you haven't done any ships yet right like why not just go find some of (09:33) these guys who are super neglected no we we're all working with those as well (09:39) so is this it seems like I see a lot of startups (09:43) where they're basically the high level pitch is there's these Brokers that make (09:47) a lot of money and we're going to cut them out with technology and take all (09:51) the money um but I mean just as a general form (09:54) like the most uh yeah obvious for me and familiar to most (09:58) of us is like the real estate market right like Redfin or someone was going (10:01) to come in and just blow away the Brokers but so far it seems like I don't (10:05) know if I've seen any of that those markets it seems like the Brokers are (10:08) very good at holding on to their position so the key key thing in this (10:13) market I mean I mean there's one thing to say that we still have Brokers and so (10:17) we're not a pure technology play We're enabling our Brokers to be much smarter (10:21) than anyone else and the cool thing about this Market is that (10:25) um intelligence is the main driver uh Traders reward their Brokers with deals (10:31) based on intelligence because you need that intelligence to keep getting good (10:35) rates so if\"}",
